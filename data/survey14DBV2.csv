possible. For example, I identified that Blackboard wouldn&#39;t open for me AT ALL, and

a problem with a specific course not showing up, I identified a problem with being 
unable to open blackboard at all...this is a minor issue, but taking the time to read 
email carefully and pay attention to the actual nature of the problem can save 
frustration for both parties

"I have two graduate degrees (master's and doctorate) that I ordered on the TT web site. While 
the site allowed the entry of dates of degrees (I have a gap of 8 years or so between getting my 
master's and doctorate), the site was a little confusing when lumping the dates of two graduate 
degrees together. I wanted to put a note of explanation like this comment when I ordered, but 
the site did not allow such. I did order two sets, fearing that I might get just my master's 
transcript or my doctor's transcript if I did not order two. Does one graduate transcript set cover 
two graduate degrees? I did not know but went ahead and paid for two not knowing if I will get 
four official transcripts (two copies of master's and two copies of doctorate) or two (one master's; 
one doctorate), because of a possible delay. Thus, I would be covered whatever the answer was. -

"Again, I would like to commend Ismael Ramirez.  Not only was I able to contact him 
via email, but he came over in 15 minutes. He is always and was very prompt and 
courteous. 
HOWEVER-
My big issue is that I had contacted IT since Thursday, the 30th, and no one 
followed up on it. I even emailed Ojay Barbee on Friday, (he usually comes out for 
anyone in my division, and Paul Frazier told me to just email him,) but his response 
was to call 742-HELP. Where as, when I emailed Ismael, he responded right after I 
emailed him, and came by 15 minutes later.
Overall, I was very disappointed with IT. I did not have a computer for 2 full days, 
and both of my bosses kept wondering why no one would come out and help. 
Ismael is the only reason I put very satisfied on this survey.

everything I can to help from doing the recommended troubleshooting before 
contacting Support to including screenshots and videos to help the IT rep resolve 
the issue.  I was very surprised and taken aback when I first contacted you all the 
second time concerning another issue I was having. I explained in detail how 3 out of 
4 lectures were working, that I was using Chrome and had tested in the other 
recommended browsers and had confirmed Java was good.  In the next email I was 
advised to update my Flash player with no regard given that the issue might be on 
the side of whoever uploaded the lecture file.  Chrome automatically updates Flash 
so I updated it for IE and Foxfire and then sent videos of the issue I was 
experiencing as well as differences in that URL and all of the other URLs. I guess I 
just thought that if 3 out of 4 worked and they all are using the same medium then my

response (to date, still nothing done on these phones):

 Jr.

Thank you for your email.  Please, do not close this at this time.  I just walked
down to rooms 229 and 235 and I don't see a network drop, I don't see a new phone,
and no one ever emailed me to provision us with area numbers and pins for the new
phones.  

I would say nothing has been done at this point and the case should remain opened.

Thanks,

had asked the proper people to perform the requested service for me, and I trust they
did. However, no one from Tech help services nor the security arm responsible for the
alerts has ever informed me that they have, in fact, actually deleted my contact
information from the emergency bulletin messaging service.  A simple E-mail saying
had been done, would have alleviated my concern. Now, I just have to wait and see if

Java update from my computer and assisting me with downloading the older version 
again.

The only complaint I have is likely not the responsibility of IT, but perhaps some 
other TTU office.  Alex mentioned that there was a note in the system that the Java 
update had affected the INB/Banner system negatively.  If other advisors or TTU 
employees had experienced the same failure of the INB system once the most 
recent Java update was downloaded, why was this not communicated to the TTU 
community at large--especially those who utilize the INB system?  I just felt badly if 
Alex (and others in IT) had to spend the rest of the day assisting INB users with the 
same issue when perhaps a TechAnnounce or other form of communication could 
have warned INB users to not download the Java update.

like DOUBLE BACK-UP or something like that. Just a thought from my limited viewpoint--please 
take it or leave it. :)

make the changes myself through eRaider, which did not resolve the issue and then was 
requested to give further reasons for the requested change. I understand both, the first was 
a student and most likely did not fully understand the request and the second was not an 
unreasonable and quite understandable request. I merely mention this to point out that 
there seems to be some inconsistencies with the service of requests, given that I have made 
three requests for three similar issues and received vastly different resolution paths for the

"Karisa and Paul were fantastic working through this.  

Mistakes were made on the end user side that complicated the situation and the 
limited ability to interact with security@ttu.edu made it much more challenging.  It 
took 45 days to get a partner account established.  

There appears to be a major disconnect between yall and the Security@ttu.edu 
group.

This is the first time this has happened with all the folks we have attempted to 
setup.  

A thought that comes to mind; after x number of days of an unresolved item, 
maybe automatically escalating it to a level where the parties are contacted and the 
issue worked through on a one to one basis.

Anyway, your folks were fantastic and everyone was highly frustrated.

"I am starting to lose my faith in IT Help.  I was informed that in 24-48 hours I would be 
appraised of the Citrix receiver problem.  This did not happen.  I called to check, was told that 
you were still working on this issue.  While I was placed on hold, I uninstalled the Citrix 
receiver and installed it again...by then I got it to work and was able to open SPSS.  So I 
informed your tech that it was working and not the other way around.  The tech was very nice 
by the way. 

In this process, I have had students being told that the issue was actually ""the professor's 
problem or error"" and not an IT issue. 

I am afraid that I cannot consistently rely on IT HELP for assistance with Citrix receiver issues 
and I am concerned as I have nearly 50 students in a class who are relying on this service.

finally figured out that it was not a cookies, or cache issue - as tech support said
in their few emails they wrote that night. It was something to do with the hotspot. I
have since had to pay for a different internet provider to continue my distance

"For further reference, my only comment would be for the analyst read through ALL 
notes and become more familiar with an existing issue before walking through steps 
that have already been tried. I had an issue that just needed to be sent up and after 
calling several times, several analysts went through the same steps several times 
with me because they didn't know I had already tried what they were asking me to 
do. Everyone was very nice and helpful but please have future analysts become very 
familiar with existing issues and future students will appreciate it, so they won't 
have to repeat themselves several times.

"The music that plays when callers are ""on hold"" when calling IT Help Central is
_very_ annoying. I actually enjoy listening to marches, probably more than the
average person, but the music is _extremely_ loud, and I would think the rapid pace
of the music only serves to agitate the caller who is being kept on hold with a
problem he/she is trying to solve. Please, at the very least, reduce the volume of
this music (it has been this way for several years now). I would also recommend
having some music that would be more conducive to producing a calming effect on the
caller. 

It is amazing how being kept on hold for a while and having to hear this music
negatively colors my experience of contacting the help desk. Overall, I had a
pleasant and productive interaction with the person I spoke with, but came away from
the experience feeling somewhat negative, because of the lack of resolution of the
problem (which I understand will happen some times), in addition to the annoying ""on

however, we were told it would be set up with no problems.  We were not set up until 11:00 the 
2nd day of our event.  Once it was on, it was perfect.  We had set up our event through the 
Tech Club and were never told that this would be a problem.  It was odd to all the doctors 
involved that a Tech hosted event would have problems providing wireless.  I do appreciate your

least I could not find it nor could my analyst. 

My analyst was very helpful in what she did have access to, but even she could not  see 
everything she needed to in order to help me. 

Finally i did tell her that I thought these website was  not very helpful or useful. I work at the

"When I originally called, they tried to find a full time staff for me to speak with.  
There was not one available at the time and the technician on the phone went 
through some troubleshooting steps with me.  He was very courteous and was 
engaged and willing to help.  I was very appreciative.

My neutral score on overall service comes from not being contacted.  Even though I 
made a note in the account that my outside calling functions were restored, I would 
have liked to have talked to a technician about what may have caused the issue in 
the first place.

I know everyone is busy, but coming from a service desk environment myself, I 
know that communication with the customer makes a huge difference in 
satisfaction.  Even when the answer is ""I don't know what happened"", it makes the 
customer feel like you are interested and engaged.  It certainly means more than 
the standard automated closing email from the ticketing system.

Thanks for your time.

their first suggestion of something to try resulted in solving my issue. 

My issue was that after upgrading my Mac from OS 10.11.1 to 10.11.2 the TTU VPN would give authentication 
failures. Other VPNs I use still worked. The solution was to add ""ttu\"" in front of my eraider username. I 
recommend updating the setup instructions for the VPN to note this new requirement. It appears on the

communicate the reason you are trying to contact an individual, such as this is texas tech university calling 
for Monte Whatley.

Thanks for your quick help, and even calling me the first time when I had not yet responded to the email
",__label__1
"By the time I got the solution I had already found someone to help me. Part of the 
problem may be that I did not receive the first email with the link, so I am not sure 
how quickly a solution was offered. 
When I got the solution it did not address what I had asked for. However, I found 
the solution myself, so it did not make difference either way. So, I do not wish to be 
called about the problem. It has been solved. 

In general, I think that better training for IT HelpCentral student workers would be 
helpful. One skill that needs to be addressed is the skill to listen to understand the 
problem at hand. and not jump to conclusions about what the caller needs. This has 
been an ongoing issue for me with IT HelpCentral. 
I have also noticed that lately that there seems to be a push to close cases asap. 
This semester, I have been asked almost every time I call whether IT can go ahead 
and close the case - even though no real solution was offered. It might be good to 
train workers",__label__2

Raiderlink.  I had to click several spots to get around the certification check and
questions.  The last few days I have been able to log directly into Raiderlink

whether I was still experiencing any of these issues.  No, I am no longer having any
problems.  I very much appreciate that IT Help Central contacted me a couple weeks
after initiating the request to be sure the system was working smoothly for me.

what now seems to be more related ttu's it policy decisions that are made and forced 
on us users without the due diligence of proper testing or even consulting with the users

my ticket and received a response from one individual who started helping me.  He

another individual responded to my ticket without looking at my responses to the 
first person; I was starting over with another individual. When I pointed this out, 
the response I received was the system was designed so other individuals can look 
at the ticket.  While that may true, the second person should have read my other 
emails and answered accordingly. However, the next morning, an IT technician 
came over and solved the problem. He was courteous and took the time find the

"Thank you so much to Shadi Dissi, a student IT consultant who helped me get my 
computer reconnected to my Tech Share drive where my folders are stored so that I 
could work on a project for chancellor Duncan, President Schovanec, and Dean 
Zahler. He said that he would transfer me to a supervisor; however, I told him my 
issue which was that I lost my connection to the TTU VPN, and I told him that if he 
could help me, I would be happy with that. He agreed that he could. He was very 
helpful to me in guiding me through the many steps required in getting the VPN 
reconnected. He was thoughtful and encouraging, and I was confident that he could 
guide me to success. He did a great job! I told him that he was a miracle worker. 
There is no way that I could have done this myself.

I appreciate Shadi, who is a Mechanical Engineering student. He is an outstanding 
representative of the Help Desk and IT at TTU.  Thank you so much to Shadi and to 
all of you!

things be done more quickly.  Had this been me as staff or a student then I understand doing it

worked I offered to sign out and call back if there was a problem, he said no and stuck with me. Just 
seconds later the file rejected, and he tried another solution.

new format and he had to repeat information because of my misunderstanding.  I am 80 years

that helped me was a young man and he was very helpful and explained the 
problem to me in a manner I could understand.  He explained that laptop was not 
on domain; so he fixed the problem promptly.  Later today I called and spoke to a 
young lady about another problem...I was left on hold off and on for 25 min. and

back through the checklist and stepped in like she was there from the start. I also think she

as we like to know who's who once they leave the premises.

Also, my printer is no longer hooked up to my computer. I've tried to troubleshoot
it, but I have not been successful.  

Thanks for all you do!

"We were a bit over zealous in security on this one.  HOWEVER, I would rather be 150%
secure than to accidentally click on a link in what appeared to be a suspicious

very long link.  The link and lack of other information in the email, even though
Trintech is a company name we do business with, looked suspicious.  

We also do business with CitiBank but all of campus get those scammer emails
supposedly from Citibank saying ""2 suspicious attempts have been made to access your
account"" when I don't even have an account with Citibank.  Some TTU employees do use
Citibank.

prefer to err on the side of being secure in the current environment of hackers,
scammers and phishing.  My computer remains virus free, phishing is unsuccessful

"Colby was very helpful and didn't give up.

Unfortunately, it LOOKS as though my problem is bigger than I thought. I discovered earlier today 
that I can now go to the Faculty link in Raiderlink, and select a term.

Unfortunately, what I find when I attempt to view my student list is, ""You have no assigned sections 
for this term."" 

When I look at the Employee Dashboard, the last class listed is Spring 2016 (which is correct), and 
nothing for this semester.  

I'm teaching right now. From my perspective, it seems as though somewhere in this system is a 
gap, a place where some bit of work wasn't done to show that I am hired. Maybe it's something I 
didn't do, but no one seems to be able to tell me what it is. Maybe it's something someone on 
campus didn't do. I doubt if it's a problem with IT, but I've gotten farther communicating with you 
than asking questions elsewhere.  Do you have any idea what I can do next?

"There was only two emails between us, so not much service was provided, not that
y'all did anything wrong, there just wasn't any technical help other than try another
browser, the only other question I would have, is why is it not working on Google Chrome?

"Please advise on how to prevent this lockout problem. We didn't address this. It 
happens every time I update my password (sometime last week or so). When Wifi network tries to connect to my cell phone or other way around I guess, and fails,,, it continues to try to connect and then I'm locked out of my work pc. I don't want to turn off my mobile network bc I need to be able to stay in contact with my husband as well as get texts.

"Your analysts are wonderful. But the compatibility of TTU-sponsored software with Mac 
platforms is constantly a problem. Outlook and Skype for Business need adjustments every time 
I login. I would be very willing to attend classes on how to optimize Macs for Office365 if 
someone would please offer them.
