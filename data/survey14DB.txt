I had talked with a number of people in IT both formally and informally trying to
discover the key to Dr Gale's VPN issue.  When I made this request, I had expected
the same "It's a problem on his end" answer I had received before.  I was very
pleasantly surprised to discover the fault lay not in technology, but in his status
with TTU.  Hopefully, the request to give him a Research Partner account will go as
smoothly.

Scott,  
  
The customer, Mr. Saroj Adhikari, is unhappy with the timeliness of the issue. The issue was resolved with the initial interaction. The issue went into waiting on customer status for 5 business days before someone followed up to confirm the resolution.
 
 I've asked Mr. Adhikari to provide the web address where he found the information â€œeraider account information will be issued after 3-4 
 days of application submission date.â€ I will check this information for correctness.

Thank you for following up with me on this.

I am not sure if the problem was caused by the IT division per see, but my
situation is as follows and I'd appreciate it if you can help me resolve
it:

I just wanted to check the status of my application for a PhD in Civil
Engineering Spring 2016 through my eraider account.  I have been asked to
update my password to log in to my TT eraider account but also I have been
asked to enter my R-number.

I contacted the IT system at TT and received the following response:

"Thank you for contacting IT Help Central. You contacted us for assistance
with resetting your password for Issue #*470080*. All students, no matter
if you are in the applied stage or admitted to the university have a
student ID number or known as R-Number. *In order to get this R-Number you
will need to contact the Graduate Admissions Office and they will be able
to give that number to you*. Once you have that number you can proceed with
changing your password and checking your admission status. I have provided
you with the Graduate Admissions Office contact information below."

I have contacted the graduate admissions office asking for my R-number, but
unfortunately I still haven't received anything from them yet.

Accordingly, now I don't know anything about my application status because
I can't acess my eraider account, given that I don't have my R-number!  I
would appreciate it if the IT department could help me rest the password in
order to access my account.

Thank you very much for you understanding, and plaese accept my apologies
for the long e-mail.

Best Regards,

Full Name: Raya Abdullah Al-Masri

Date of Birth: August 18th, 1987

Application ID: 00624876

Program of Interest: PhD in Civil Engineering-Spring 2016

Raya Al-Masri,

I do apologize about the unfortunate circumstances preventing you from getting the information you need to check your application status. I believe a phone call will help clear everything up. I will start a conference call with my organization, IT Help Central, and the Graduate Admissions Office so we can get you your R-number and access to your eRaider account.

After the call, please respond to this e-mail and let me know if you can access your eRaider account and check your application status. I want to be sure your issue is resolved.

Thank you again,

Wish you a pleasant day! Thanks again!

portal login. It is working totally fine.

  I contacted the customer  with regard to the comments he'd left. I let him know we would reopen  the issue and continue working with him. The customer's frustration was that his Primary Support Provider could not assist him. I advised him his survey did not apply to his PSP. I offered to give him Desktop Support as he has backup Desktop Support. Desktop Support's manager, Ric, agreed to provided assistance. When desktop attempted to give him additional support, he refused their help.

Is one drive just not supported by the university? Our IT person also does not have any 
suggestions for how to resolve the issue.

The customer was dissatisfied because the issue he was experiencing was attributed to a global issue. It was not related. Also the issue he was experiencing has no documented information. 


The issue was attached to the global due too genuine miscommunication. The agent and customer used the same terminology with different definitions.

The registration issue he was having is due to a Windows 10 Update error. The askIT solution: 160224155316360 has the information that was needed to resolved this issue but it has not been published yet.

I called the customer at 806-8347017. Ms. King stated this survey should be attached to a different issue (472102). She requested to be called back later in the afternoon.

I will research the other issue and call her back this afternoon. I called the customer.

She was unhappy that she was given inaccurate information at first that led to delays in getting a software suit installed. Scott,

The customer was correct. Jacob Kemp did give out inaccurate information. David Gutierrez could have given better information to the customer. Her issue was resolved but not in a timely manner. I have coached David. I will have Jacob coached as well. Jacob Kemp has been coached. He will also update the askIT solutions so that they are more clear with regards to who may have Adobe software and how to acquire it.

Attempted to contact the customer to clarify survey ratings and no response to date. Information provided to the customer was accurate. Associate Director Chris Oglesby has given me international dialing privileges and directed me to call all customers going forward.
I called the customer, he stated he was able to activate his eRaider account. He was unable to explain his ratings.

The analyst was fantastic! He arrived in a timely manner and quickly resolved the solution. I 
don't know if I talked to the same person on the phone or not, but the analyst who answered my 
call was friendly, patient, and helpful. Rather than continuing a frustrating situation for everyone 
involved, he quickly decided to come to the classroom and reach a resolution in person. I really 
appreciate the help I received today.

IT Help was very rude and I ended up fixing my own problem and missed part of my 
online class dealing with his bogus suggestions.

Jacob Kemp helped me above and beyond! My computer screen was horribly damaged and you couldn't see 
anything that would be able to help you figure out where to go but Jacob didn't let that discourage him. I 
explained to him that I had 3 years worth of videos and pictures on there from my college experience and he 
was able to recover everything and put it on a flash drive for me. Everything was done in an hour and half and 
it was worth he wait. He was excellent!

I'm meant to say I was VERY SATISFIED with his work. Please disregard the other survey but read the 
comment below! Jacob Kemp was amazing and helped me above and beyond. My computer screen was 
completely finished but he powered through and helped me recover 3 years of data from my computer and then 
he put it on a flash drive. The whole process took and hour and a half and it was more than worth the wait. He 
was diligent and explained everything to me and I'm definitely more educated on computers and their proper 
care. Thank you Jacob!

The projector had problems that you can only resolve with a remote control for the
projector.  There is not one of these in the room and the instructor cannot know in
advance if the previous instructor has done things to make the projector inoperable
until the class is about to start.  Hmmmm.  The technician who showed up luckily had
one of these and was able to resolve the problem quickly.  The touch pad in the
console seems still to be a bit jinxed - sound controls seem off line.

Dr. Roach, 
  
Our Quality Control team within IT Help Central flagged your survey response in MCOM 253 about the projector and sound issues. I went to the room to investigate the sound issues and the projector when I saw the survey response. Upon investigation I noticed the sound was working as it should in the room and the projector was turning on with the system.  
  
With deeper investigation I was able to diagnose and resolve a few laptop issues in the room and have revamped the GUI design on the panel with new configurations. Hopefully this will help resolve any issues in the room.  
  
I would like to know if you are still experiencing issues in the room, and to let me know so I can work more closely to resolve any issues in the room.  
If further assistance is needed with the technology in our General Purpose Classrooms (GPC), please  contact IT Help Central - Classroom Technology Services by calling  806-742-5381, or email ctsstaff.ithelpcentral@ttu.edu.

Actually, it was graduate department job but they had told me to contact the it
department help who agin told me to contact graduate department. Currently (just
now), with trial and error was able to open my portal so problem is solved. Yet,
should adopt different password recovery policy as we are just applicant and we dont
remember the R-number (university ID) for each application. Should be like sending
the recovery link to the email Id or asking personal information like date of birth,
etc before sending recovery link for any security.

Brian is, as you must know, is an absolute superstar.  He shows up time, is unfailingly polite, and 
never stops until the issue is resolved.  He takes an ownership stake in the issue and that carries 
a lot of weight, especially in an age when it seems representatives do everything in their power to 
escape any responsibility.  We LOVE it when we see Brian head out to do the job.

This was probably the best experience I have had when calling the IT Help Desk.  
John (I believe that was his name) was very helpful, friendly, and expedited a work-
around for my issue to get my email up and running on my cell phone almost 
immediately.  He had no problem staying on the phone with me until I was able to 
verify that my issue was completely fixed, and this is the first time where I did not 
feel like I was imposing on the technician to have them stay on the line.  Kudos to 
his work ethic!

The customer was upset with the lack of knowledge of the agent. The technical skills needed to resolve the problem were beyond the SA's capability and he escalated the issue appropriately.  The root of the problem was with a third-party's e-mail account, not the customer he called. ITHC personnel did troubleshoot the issue but the third-party contacted ITHC in a separate issue (477670)     The customer was informed of this by the third party. We did not attempt to give him this information or inform him that the third party would need to contact ITHC.

Karisa called me promptly and explained the process/procedures of how name 
changes effect emails. She talked me through what was happening and even told 
me when things should be processed ex. Name changes generally take 48 hours for 
GAL to update. I genuinely appreciated knowing these "small" details because it 
makes me more aware. Thank you Karisa!

Once Brian Pohl was put on the case he got it handled quickly and even followed up 
with me several times to make sure the problem was corrected.  The IT Help Desk 
was a little less helpful and it took over six hours to get someone to address my 
problem.  During that time I had no computer or telephone access.

This was a email only interaction. The response confirmed my suspicion of the issue. I still think 
there is too much spam email for TTU mail on a daily basis. Most of it ends up in the junk folder 
but it is a chore to have to go through the list several times a day to see if something wasn't put 
in junk by mistake since I have the safe blocks on.

This spam email incident was insidious because at first glance it looked legitimate but open 
examination it was very suspicious so I sent it in for verification.

On the timeliness of the service provided I was very disappointed on how long it took for the initial 
issue to be identified and resolved. Several calls only accomplished me being told that the issue 
was being escalated and would be resolved in a matter of days. However more than 2 weeks 
passed before it was finally resolved.
However I was extremely satisfied with the level of service during the walk-in visits, both at the 
Administrative Support Building and the Sneed Computer Lab. The staff in both offices were very 
helpful in explaining to me what they were attempting to do and in communicating the possible 
causes. All three of the walk in visits felt very informative and helpful.

His issue had several components which I explained caused the length of his issue. He stated he continuously has issues with his computer being flagged by registration for not being on the ttu.edu domain. I created another issue for him and a student will working with him to discover root cause. Please add Frederic Soro to the list.

The analyst I talked to on the phone did not know how to fix the problem, and did not take the 
time to figure out how or ask their adviser how. Instead, they very quickly referred me to one of 
the residential IT help offices. 

In contrast, the IT help office knew exactly how to address the issue and search for the reasons I 
was experiencing this! They said they had seen several cases with the same issue. 

This is NOT my first time with this problem concerning the Bradford network security scan!! And 
I know Im not the only one with this problem!

The student analyst fabricated information and told the customer her network scans were likely caused by recent network outages. I have quality flagged the agent so that he may be coached by his mentor. I've attempted to contact the customer but have received no response yet.

The problem was Dr. Fedler was not in the system do to employment changes (ePAF)

Claims agents said it was a Windows 10 issue. He claims he said something about his position change. Customer suggest we make sure our tier one agents reach out for assistance when needed.

The customer, Dr. Fedler, is unhappy we referred him to his primary support provider, Engineering Computer Support. He says,  "Those guys can't fix anything." He contacted another person familiar with Xtender and they discovered his ePAF had changed in a way denying him access to Xtender. Dr. Fedler claims we gave him information stating Windows 10 was the problem. This is not true. He suggested we train our employees to reach out when further help is needed. Our employees followed proper procedure for dealing with this issue; he found help elsewhere while within the W.O.C. life-cycle. Dr. Fedler stated he was overly harsh in retrospect and was happy for the follow-up.

The only issue I really had with this process was the relentless persistence.  I understand 
reaching out to help solve issues, but a phone call to two different phones every day is a bit 
much.  Allow the person time to resolve the issue.  Send me an email to follow up and if I don't 
reply, call me 48 hours later.  I do not bring my laptop to work with me, so I could only work on 
this issue at home in which my time is limited.  So, please refrain from calling/emailing as often.

his co-worker.

The reason I am neutral on the quality and overall satisfaction is that this has been an ongoing 
issue for some time now (at least 2 semesters) and even longer for sound and other technical 
issues in the room. The equipment should be more reliable and consideration for the instructor 
and students should be given priority in solving this issue.

Chase Fleming resolved a problem which has plagued our department for 7 months through 
careful analysis and insight into how databases are supposed to work.  I cannot say enough 
about how helpful this resolution will be for the work of the graduate assistants and me in the 
department.  When I have ordinary problems I go through the IT desk, but when it is something 
more challenging I am very glad to have Chase as a contact.  He is incredibly good at not only 
providing customer service but knowing how to work nicely with people.  I could go on and on 
about how happy our team is that Chase was able to solve our problem.  Thank you to who ever 
hired him and gives Chase the encouragement and support to provide such terrific customer 
service.

Nick was very helpful and sought out the proper answer to correct my mailbox issue. I appreciate him 
looking for solutions with a supervisor when he didn't have a ready answer to provide. Because he was 
willing to take this extra step, he got me the information I needed! I did have to hold a little while, but 
I do not mind that at all when it results in my problem being solved right the first time!

I would appreciate when you call to leave a message.  I still am not sure how it works, i.e. when 
the SEND button doesn't appear because I am in the EDIT mode of an email and ended up 
having to use an alternative email for the business transaction.

Original Issue = 481354

Original Assignees = ITHC Service Desk Student Supervisor, ITHC Service Desk Student Technician I called the customer at 512-9180305.

The customer was dissatisfied with the amount of time it took Admissions to get him his eRaider credentials. Also he still cannot upload his admissions documentation and has been advised by admissions to use e-mail instead.

I informed the customer the survey he completed was with regard only to IT Help Central and the IT Division. He said his experience with IT was stellar. I asked if he'd like to revise his ratings, he said only if I passed his information to the appropriate people. I told him I would give the information to management.

Two weeks ago, I tried to talk to someone at IT Central, explain the problem and try
to help everyone's time with this issue since it happened before and I knew how to
fix it. I know there are procedures that have to be followed, but I also think that
the voice of the customer counts and in this particular case I had evidence of the
previous issue with an IT Ticket number associated. Thankfully this time it didn't
take one month to solve as the previous event, it took two weeks though. This was a
very simple fix and it could have been solved in one day. I really IT keeps track of
the fixes and in case this issue happens again, it can be fixed quicker. Your help is
always appreciated! From my personal perspective, it is good to receive the good and
the bad feedback and use them positively for improvement.

I called the customer at 513-3999377

Customer is upset that he told several agents what might be the cause as he had the same symptoms in a prior issue (same issue: 26716) and it was. He attempted to expedite the problem but it still took two weeks.

This has happened every other month. I advised the customer I would look into a long term solution. The customer says that other people have had this problem as well. I asked him if he could provide their names so we could research their issue history and present a pattern of failure to Telecomm for investigation. 
Mr. Carlos De Niz Perez Negron,

Thank you for taking  time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with  IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and  made notes of areas where we can improve our service. We spoke about the need for a permanent solution to the "EETX31" switch exceeding its MAC address buffer problem.

You stated you may have the names of people who have had this problem as well. Any information you can provide would help accelerate our investigation. 
Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,

J.D. Campbell-Walker

The customer was unhappy with upset that he told several agents what might  be the cause as he had the same symptoms in a prior issue (same issue:  26716) and it was. He attempted to expedite the problem but it still  took two weeks. It appears Priscilla Lopez did not use the askIT article information regarding inoperable ports and closed the issue prematurely. 


I also spoke with the customer about the need for a permanent solution to the "EETX31" switch exceeding its MAC address buffer problem. He state this happens every other month and he'd try to get the names of others who had called in so we could launch a root cause investigation.

The analyst was very courteous, but she couldn't help me. She suggested I needed 
to leave the campus to I try to access the website I needed. I understand it's not 
her fault that my student organization's webpage is having an issue (for some 
reason, it's been blocked as a phishing site by TTU), but I can't help feeling 
dissatisfied that I can't access a legitimate website from campus.

The customer is upset that she can't access her student organizational website which is hosted on Weebly. I have attempted to contact her to no avail. I have reopened the issue and directed Quality Management students to provide her with alternative web hosting solutions.  
  
I have spoken with the student analyst, Monica Rodriguez, and gave her the same information as well.

I wasn't always kept in the loop as far as what was wrong with my telephone or how
long it might take to replace it if that was necessary. As a result, it was a little
difficult trying to schedule phone conferences last week. Still, I'm thrilled to have
a functioning telephone again. Thanks so much for all that you guys (and gals) do!

This did take about 4-5 calls before the issue was resolved. If changes in the
password features of INB (oracle) banner have been changed, employees that access
would benefit from an email notification. I have used in the past a password that had
1 capital letter, 1 number and 1 special character. Only this time no special
characters could be used. Of course this was only one of the issues causing the
disruption. But eventually we got all of them resolved.

Scott, 
  
I have reached out to the customer for service recovery. It appears he had one symptom (no internet) with two issues: first his registry (according to RHS) was corrupt and second, his dorm experienced a network outage.  
  
As a side note, Zachary Mata added notes to the Global Issue twice. This may have contributed to the customer's frustrations. He has been quality flagged for inappropriate use.

The Help Desk responded quickly and attempted to resolve the problem. I was provided
some instruction that proved unsuccessful. I contacted them again and they tried from
their end. Nothing worked so I contacted the Graduate school (this was suggested by
the Help Desk). Within a day, I received an email asking me to retry. Whatever they
did from their end worked and I as able to complete the survey. Thank you for the
excellent customer service!

Ryon Ever (unsure of spelling of last name) helped me.  He was most helpful.  While 
we did not solve the problem which related to printing my W-2 form with all the 
boxes showing.  I had printed it earlier, but could not print it again.  He was very 
resourceful, but we could not make it work today.  I think the problem may be with 
the Raiderlink employee site.

I always think the TTU Help desk is great to help me, and this was another great 
performance.  Thanks so much for all you do for TTU employees and students.  I 
think you are great!

Everyone I talked to was professional and nice. The issue took a lot longer than I would have 
thought was necessary however. I also, at times, didn't feel I was listened too. There were 
numerous individuals calling, and I felt like I had to repeat myself rather than information being 
shared. 

I quickly realized that difference in service between being  just a student versus being a staff 
member.
Original Issue = 474083
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = ITHC Service Desk Staff I called Katie at 806-7432312. 


Katie was unhappy she had to reiterate her problem several times to different employees.I informed her the problem she had was extremely intricate and I had checked for problems with redundancy but it appears they were all legitimate troubleshooting steps. 


Katie was also disappointed with the one-on-one interaction provided by her previous department v.s. her current department. I explained to the provost office has paid for executive support and her new department doesn't. That's why there was a difference with her level of support: it did not have to do with her status as a student. 


Katie was also left in the dark as to what really solved her problem as no one had explained it to her. I gave her a brief overview of the troubleshooting that took place to resolve her issue. 


Overall she stated again she wasn't unhappy with the service so much as the timeframe but now that she had a better perspective of what happened behind the scenes she understood why. 


I informed her I would relay the information to our management team so that we can ensure this doesn't take the same amount of time in the future.

The employee on the phone was as helpful as possible; however, my issue may 
have been too complex to resolve over the phone.  Since it looked like my issue was 
going to require desktop support--and I don't have the time in my schedule right 
now to arrange for that--I was given very good advice via email about my ticket 
being closed until a more convenient time and how specifically to go about re-
opening it when best for me.  The resolve has not been resolved, but right now that 
is because of my schedule and not due to IT Help.  Hopefully, I will have a chance to 
re-open the ticket and arrange for desktop support in a few weeks.  Thank you!

Ryan Everett did his best to help me.  I am sure that I may have been a challenging 
client as I was trying very hard to resolve the issue to get back to some large 
assignments for the Chancellor.  However, he did a wonderful job.  After we talked 
my computer re-connected to my email.  

Therefore, I am very happy.

Thanks so much for the TTU IT HELP!  I appreciate all of you very much.

I was connecting to the TTUnet on my new iphone and the notice I received was that the 
network 8021x.ttu.edu was not trusted. The analyst told me to trust the site (which I did). I 
suggested that TTU fix this bug so others didn't have the same problem.

The only real minor complaint I have is received a phone call again after issue should have already been 
closed. Also, since this is a phone number where a elerly person may pay up the first time, try to simply 
communicate the reason you are trying to contact an individual, such as this is texas tech university calling 
for Monte Whatley.

Thanks for your quick help, and even calling me the first time when I had not yet responded to the email

By the time I got the solution I had already found someone to help me. Part of the 
problem may be that I did not receive the first email with the link, so I am not sure 
how quickly a solution was offered. 
When I got the solution it did not address what I had asked for. However, I found 
the solution myself, so it did not make difference either way. So, I do not wish to be 
called about the problem. It has been solved. 

In general, I think that better training for IT HelpCentral student workers would be 
helpful. One skill that needs to be addressed is the skill to listen to understand the 
problem at hand. and not jump to conclusions about what the caller needs. This has 
been an ongoing issue for me with IT HelpCentral. 
I have also noticed that lately that there seems to be a push to close cases asap. 
This semester, I have been asked almost every time I call whether IT can go ahead 
and close the case - even though no real solution was offered. It might be good to 
train workers on what constitutes a solution.

On a positive note: This time, the woman who handled my case was good about 
calling back before closing the case, making sure I had received the link, and asked 
whether she can close the case. I appreciate that very much. The reason the link 
was not helpful was that the person who initially took the call did not listen and had 
nothing to do with the most recent communication with IT. I already gave feedback 
on the initial call. No need to follow up. Thank you to the woman who called and 
checked whether I received the information. And thank you for resending it.

I called the customer at 806-742-1998x468. The extension no longer works. The phone routed me to the operator who routed me to 806-8346648 and left the following message:
This is  J.D. with IT Help Central calling for Dr. Stephanie Hart. Thank you for  taking time to provide us with feedback on your recent experience with  IT Help Central. We have received your survey and I am concerned with  some of the comments you've left. I would like to speak with you and  discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you  can contact me directly at 806-834-0780. Dr. Stephanie Hart called back. I let her know IT Help Central is always willing to help and although we don't have her Fax number we would be willing to assist her find it with or without her Primary Support Provider. Dr. Hart already had found her fax number already. I offered to and showed her how to update her directory information and we added the fax number there. I offered her my assistance in the future. 

   
 
Scott, 
  
The customer is upset she was referred to her Primary Support Provider. She needed her new fax number. I informed her we truly did not have the information she needed. She felt reassured and thanked me for the follow up.  
  
I also checked her previous issues and there handled appropriately as well.

I know that when troubleshooting issues there are some very simple remedies that can be tried 
before escalating to higher forms of troubleshooting, but asking me twice if I have tried different 
browsers and cleared cookies or tried it on different computers is rather demeaning to my 
intelligence. In my first email, I indicated that I could not log into blackboard and that I had 
tried it on different computers and browsers. Your "IT" staff didn't seem to have the first clue as 
to how to read an email and then make progress on the issue at hand with the given 
information. It took several days to fix a simple access issue. And when the issue was resolved, 
I don't think the IT department had any hand in the fix. I tried logging on and it let me in one 
day. The IT department sent me an email and a phone call a week later asking if they could help 
me with the issue, as if they had no idea the issue had been fixed. You need to work on training 
your "IT" staff and their ability to actually troubleshoot and do it in a timely manner.

When I called for assistance, I was treated with respect. My issue was discussed and 
I was informed as to what the options of service were. Rafael came immediately to 
my office to do some testing on the equipment. At that point, he told me the next 
step and completed the paperwork necessary to inform the next department of the 
needs for this repair. Later in the day, Steven came to do the actual repair of the 
port. He was polite and informative. He left my office in the condition he found it 
after he completed the necessary repairs. I am very satisfied with the service 
provided by all in this matter.

I contacted the customer, Maria Jeffery, she did confuse this with another issue. She had a project request with Telecomm to add a network drop. Chris and I could not find the FootPrints issue where this survey should have been attached. He will reach out to Telecomm with the customer's comments.  
  
The survey she created will be deleted.

This problem took a long time to get resolved. I realize that I was asking a very specialized 
question. My biggest frustration was having to deal with a new tier one representative every time I 
called. This wasted SO much of my time. They are all very helpful and try their best to help, but 
they did not have the expertise to resolve the permissions issue with the dedicated email-box. All in 
all, I probably spent a couple of hours explaining my issue over and over again. However, when I 
was ready to give up, you kept working to solve the problem and finally got it fixed. My suggestion 
is that when someone calls with a specialized issue, assign them a dedicated rep and make sure 
that the people answering the phone transfer them directly to their rep each time they call or else 
give a direct line phone number (I finally got that kind of service, but only after many many phone 
calls.
Ultimately, I am satisfied with the service, but I am usually very satisfied. And I am impressed that 
y'all kept working on it until the solution was found. Thanks to Karissa, Ian, and all the other guys 
who helped me with this issue. Keep up the good work over there!

no knowledge of what was happening and was patient when trying to understand what I was saying.

Honestly, this was a challenging issue, so I'm not upset at the service by any means.  Though, it 
did seem like I was going around in circles a time or two, having to disrupt a number of students 
and staff in the process each time.  Hopefully, the experience we had to go through can help 
inform other similar circumstances if they arise, so that any unnecessary repetition can be 
avoided.

In the end, they got it working, and even went out of there way it seems to do so.  So, I am very 
grateful for their time, service, and any extra effort they showed for our situation.  Keep up the 
good work!

Original Issue = 488916
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = Brian Pohl The customer states that IT Help Central personnel told her there was a person on the way to the classroom and no one showed up. She states she was also told IT Help Central can assist with classroom remote controls but in reality we cannot: this is not a GPC Room. I advised the customer I would research the call and provide disciplinary action where appropriate. After listening to the call, the student obtained information from the customer, then informed them that desktop would be over shortly to assist them with the issue. The customer wasn't necessarily told that ITHC would be able to assist, but that the issue would be sent to someone who could. The analyst did say "desktop" would come and assist which is the incorrect department to assign this issue to. The student employee that gave the incorrect information, Daniel Revetti, no longer works at IT Help Central.

The first problem was taken care of in a timely manner.

On Friday when we found out the VPN did not work the person that answered the 
call did not know what she was doing and did not transfer the call/problem to some 
one that could help. This problem left the employee without her normal computer 
and working at a different desk for a week. If my students were not taking finals 
during this time we would have been short a desk and computer for 8 days.

The technician that showed up to help today was wonderful!!

The customer said that the Student Analyst Stephenie was did not have knowledge on the issue, she refused to transfer the phone call, and was on the phone for an hour. Sharon said the everyone else that worked on the issue was amazing. I listen to both calls between the customer and Stephanie. The customer insisted she needed to setup the TTUnet VPN. Stephanie asked several times if she was sure you needed the TTUnet VPN setup and customer confirmed this each time. Stephanie's steps were appropriate for troubleshooting TTUnet VPN.

In reality the customer needed the PCI VPN. Once an agent was dispatched on site, this was discovered immediately and the issue was resolved quickly.

The home usage problems I reported were still happening last night but the home issue is okay 
this morning. The problem at work of Outlook requesting credentials while I am successfully 
connected is still happening.
I would be interested in knowing if you saw any issues on your side or repaired anything related 
to my issue.

I first requested help over the phone.  I spoke to two different individuals and 
neither could figure out how to install my ttu email into my phone.  Finally, they 
suggested I stop by the ITHELP desk for assistance.  I did and the technician I saw 
was wonderful!!  The ratings above are about him. 
The other two individuals were great too, but could not solve the problem for me.
Great job!!

Chris,
 
 Sorry, I was working with Xavi on the schedule when you sent this.  Iâ€™ve reviewed this issue and it appears that we engaged ITTS â€“ Systems Admin who advised that the customer work with the professor to address the issue of re-submitting an assignment on Blackboard.  Robert Ward notified the customer of resolution and it appears that the customer was not pleased with Tier IIIâ€™s findings.  I will attempt to follow up with the professor on the customerâ€™s behalf, and Xavi can follow-up with the customer this evening to advise them that we will research additional options.

 www.twitter.com/IT_HelpCentral I called Professor Lap Siu back,

He was unable to use his e-mail with the Google Chrome browser but was able to use it with Firefox and Internet Explorer. This was his original problem while in walk-up services. The customer stated our analyst kept telling him he was entering the password incorrectly. He feels like the agent didn't listen to him because his password  worked with other browsers and services using eRaider authentication.

Professor Siu say the agent didn't acknowledge him when he walked in but did admit it was overly busy at walk-up services.

Professor Siu called today and had another agent resolve the issue by changing his password.

I apologized to Professor Siu for our poor customer service and promised the agent would be coached appropriately. I coached Christian Arroyo on customer service skills today during coaching for another issue.

This was a nightmare, but not because of your help.....the only thing that someone did not know 
was how to remove a password from my I-phone....we did that today with Jerod's help and with 
our own departmental IT person.

Overall I was very happy with what Kirk, Chad and Jerod did for me...the limitation was cell phone 
service in Junction, which was terrible.

Please provide your employees with more information when basics won't solve the issue such as corrupt 
plist files on a Mac
Original Issue = 489971
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = ITHC Service Desk Student Supervisor, ITHC Service Desk Student Technician 
I called the customer at 281-9004747
The customer said he was unsatisfied with the troubleshooting skills of the agents and the time he spend in walk-up services.

The customer said the agent did basic troubleshooting the he'd already performed. I advised him this is standard operating procedure.

The customer said the agent did further troubleshooting then said there was nothing more he could do. The agent advised him our Mac experts were not in the office and he may wish to come back tomorrow. When the customer pressed him for possible further troubleshooting steps, the agent said it may have been a problem with his plist files. The customer said he then spent 30 minutes Google Searching the problem and found the answer.

I advised the customer that altering p-list files constituted an alteration of the operating system and that our agents are now allowed to do this. He stated the agent did not express this to him but he could understand that policy if it were stated.
The customer said walk-up services said maybe it was a corrupt p-list files. And he found the problem by google searching.


I asked him about his rating for timeliness and said it was concerning the time spent at walk-up services not the duration of the issue.

The customer was at walk-up services Tuesday June 7th about 4:10PM

I apologized and thanked the customer for his time and input. He mentioned a new job and asked if we were hiring. I told him we weren't currently but I'd contact him around the first of August and let him know if we were then. 

   
 
Scott, 
  
I reached out to the customer, William Shepherd, earlier today. His frustration stems from the amount of time spent in walk-up (1.5 hours) and the lack of clear cohesive instructions given by the analyst there. 
  
Mr. Shepherd could not connect a laptop to the TTUnet WIFI. He states the analyst in walk-up did great with troubleshooting & customer service until they ran out of ideas. He states at that point the customer stated he could: 1) wait for a Mac expert that may be in the next way but not sure when 2)  give up 3) look online for help with his P-list files.  The customer fixed the problem on his own by deleting the P-list files but doesn't know why the analyst couldn't do the same. 
  
The issue notes do not reflect a visit to walk-up support and I could not find an issue that approximated Mr. Shepherd's problem. The two analyst scheduled for walkup at the time Mr. Shepherd indicated were Jorge Soto and Mikolaj Firlej.
 
 I recommend we clarify whether P-list file modifications are supported or unsupported issues in  askIT. Also stress the importance of updating FootPrints for each customer.

The first few email contacts I had regarding this issue were totally unhelpful-- a 
couple of them just pointed out an issue with no offer of a solution (e.g., letting me 
know that I need to be connected to a TTU internet source when I had already 
specified in the previous emails that I had tried that). However, when I would get to 
speak to someone in person, they were very helpful

The tech was unable to fix my problem which seems to be on the TTU side.  The solutions 
offered were all solutions I had googled in the first place.

I reached out to the customer, Danny Lee Johnston, yesterday for service recovery but he has not yet responded. The call was unusually long (1 hour) but beyond this I am unable to find anything wrong with the call.

Call Audit Notes: Chad did not take down the number the customer gave him: 406-363-4891
  Directed customer towards none free software. Chad did not instruct the customer to purchase any software. The customer decided this on his own. Extensive silent time without putting the customer on hold. Stopping recording at 26:00 

Call Audit Notes: Chad instructs the customer to check random boxes in the Flip4Mac control panel. Chad doesn't respond to the customer at times as though he's not engaged. Chad should reach out for assistance when he's at a loss for a next step. Chad did not attempt to say the closing remarks. 

 
  I called the customer at 406-363-4891

    I spoke with Danny:
   
  His issue is not resolved. I offered further assistance he declined as the exam he needed the video for has already passed.
   
  His primary objection is that the call did not resolve his issue. He felt like he found the same information as Chad did. 

I held a coaching session 06/27/2016 with Chad Milne regarding how best to handle this call in the future. We discussed call control, reaching out for assistance, and active listening. He also pointed out the askIT article that seems to need to be replaced. 

I met with Tim Gary and Ian Wilkinson regarding an alternative to using the Flip4Mac plug-in to view Windows Media Video (WMV) type videos while using OS X.
   
  Ian stated the first thing the customer always needs to do (which may help in all situations) is visit the Mediasite Viewing Requirements website: https://support.sonicfoundry.com/Training/ViewingRequirements . The Mac customer needs to have Silverlight playback support installed. Ian also says any WMV videos needs to be converted to another format more friendly to OS X. He ask anytime a WMV type videos is found to gather information about the video, assign the issue to him, and he will have the video re-encoded into another format. Tim says we need to follow the advise of Ian but that when he is unavailable an internal solution needs to be in place. He recommends VLC be used where necessary. I will have a replacement solution created. 

Randall has retired the Flip4Mac askIT article. Two new article need to be create. 1) How to play Windows Media Video files on your Mac using VLC. This should simply direct the customer to VLC to download and install. 2) Windows Media Video in Mediasite will not play properly or at all. This should follow the steps outlined in the previous description and resolution field. 

   
 
Scott, 
  
Upon further investigation it appears the askIT solution that was used to assist the customer is outdated. Iâ€™ve worked with Tim Gary, Ian Wilkinson, and Randall King to have the old solution retired and begin creating a new one.

The first time I called in, the young man who helped me wasn't very knowledgeable. 
I finally had to ask for a supervisor. Unfortunately, he wasn't much help either. 
Luckily for me, I called this morning and got Gerald, who was marvelous. He was 
very polite, knowledgeable, and walked me step by step through solving my original 
problem and then some other issues that arose while we were speaking. I now have 
Office 365 successfully installed on my laptop and the proper configuration to get on 
TTUnet. Gerald is an asset to your department.

Thanks for taking care of this - migration process. It took several days (too many),
so maybe next summer it can be solved in 48 hrs max. (?) :-) 

Thanks for your kind, courteous reply and all your efforts to address and solve the
situation. Graduate students (especially those who teach undergrad classes on line)
have also experienced some frustration with their e-mails, and lack of communication
with students and professors - but now several said they are happy that it was solved...

 Facebook based TTU groups made up for the gap - at least in part. 

Happy summer and thanks for your assistance.

The customer, Dr. Magdalena Toda, is dissatisfied with the timeliness of the issue. She is referring to the amount of time it took to resolve the global issue with graduate studentâ€™s e-mail accounts being migrated to on-premise exchange.   
  
Her comments are all positive with exception to the timeliness. I have reached out to her for service recovery and she has not yet responded.

Dear Mr Campbell-Walker, 
    Thanks for trying to contact me via phone. I am busy with several meetings each day. I submitted a survey showing that I was generally happy with how the IT staff handled the problem. However, it took about one week to perform the migration process for our graduate student populations. Meanwhile, they had theses to submit, they had classes to teach, they had enrollment issues, and so, it is not acceptable that e-mails would be unusable (or would bounce back) for more than 2 days. Please make sure that next year the process will take 24-48 hours at most, and it will be done during the weekend, rather than during the week. 
 
 I would score the attitude and effort of the IT reps a 5/5, and the timeliness in action 2/5 (it took many e-mails and many days). Keep up the good work!

Dr. Toda, 
  
Thank you for your time and response. I will ensure your survey is updated to reflect this additional information. The migration process experience an error that caused the delay; they are generally performed within an hour.  
  
The migration process is run my another department within the IT Division and I will make sure your voice is heard. Please accept my apologizes for any inconvenience this has caused.  
  
If there is anything I can do for you in the future, please do not hesitate to ask.

Dear Mr Campbell-Walker, 
    Thanks for trying to contact me via phone. I am busy with several meetings each day. I submitted a survey showing that I was generally happy with how the IT staff handled the problem. However, it took about one week to perform the migration process for our graduate student populations. Meanwhile, they had theses to submit, they had classes to teach, they had enrollment issues, and so, it is not acceptable that e-mails would be unusable (or would bounce back) for more than 2 days. Please make sure that next year the process will take 24-48 hours at most, and it will be done during the weekend, rather than during the week. 
 
 I would score the attitude and effort of the IT reps a 5/5, and the timeliness in action 2/5 (it took many e-mails and many days). Keep up the good work!
 
 Thanks, and regards,
 M. Toda

All, 
  
Dr. Toda has responded. She wishes to express that she is â€œgenerally happy with how the IT staff handled the problemâ€ but â€œit is not acceptable that e-mails would be unusable (or would bounce back) for more than 2 days.â€ 
 
 She also stated this: â€œPlease make sure . . . the process will take 24-48 hours at most, and it will be done during the weekend, rather than during the week. 
  
I advised her this was a one-off instance that should not happen again but that I would present her concerns to management.

Scott, 
  
The customer, Dr. Magdalena Toda, is dissatisfied with the timeliness of the issue. She is referring to the amount of time it took to resolve the global issue with graduate studentâ€™s e-mail accounts being migrated to on-premise exchange.   
  
Her comments are all positive with exception to the timeliness. I have reached out to her for service recovery and she has not yet responded.

I do not know if the problem was solved or what the solution was.  It would be extremely helpful if 
the instructor could be CCed in on the student correspondence so that the next time the issue 
occurs the student can receive a more timely solution since the instructor can suggest how to 
solve the problem.

All, 
  
I have asked Scott for guidance with this survey. The comments left are regarding a closed-duplicate issue. The instructor/teacher, Ms. Sandra Smith, requested help on behalf of the student Madison Jennings. The issue that is still open, 494682, may or may not be supported. Scott is investigating.  
  
I have reached out to the customer for service recovery. I have provided the issue number of the open issue and, with Scottâ€™s permission, noted that the instructor should be CCâ€™d on future correspondence with the student.

I believe the person who helped me was named Jerald Hilton. Jerald was one of the most helpful 
people I've ever encountered in any form of customer service. He was kind, knowledgeable, but 
most importantly tenacious. He took on my problem like it was my own and never got frustrated 
when something didn't work, instead actively searching for the next possible thing to try.

Again, I was very impressed by him.

Sorry to be neutral. The original issue was never resolved. I still cannot see email in

to try another browser. Internet Explorer shows my email and that is what I have

Hello all, 
  
Thank you so much for going above and beyond trying to help me!  You have called several times and I have not returned the calls since the issue is with my work computer at the Southwest Collection and I have NO cell reception at my desk.  By the time I get your message, I am no longer at the computer with the problem.   
Today, I brought my home computer to the SUB and worked in Firefox with email and there was no problem, which leads me to believe the issue is with the Dell laptop at work. 
Please close this issue, and if you want to send me another survey I will fill it out VERY SATISFIED! 
  
Thanks again for all your effort, 
Cynthia Fletcher 

 

  Ms. Cynthia Fletcher,
   
  Thank you for the praise. If you'd like, I can go ahead and change your survey responses for you.
   
  I am still unhappy with the performance of your Dell Laptop. Since we are unable to help you by phone, I'd like to suggest you contact Mark Bryant (mark.bryant@tu.edu) or Blake Bowman (blake.boman@ttu.edu). These two individuals do not work for IT Help Central but instead they work on computer, in person, for your department. They may be able to assist you further.
   
  Thank you again,

The TTU IT Help Desk people were very courteous and did their best to help with what
I needed done. I can say that the staff at the TTU IT help desk were far more
diligent and responsive than the HSC IT in HSCRecords that in the end had to take
care of the request. The HSC Records department was slow and unresponsive, although
very belatedly, they did accomplish what I requested.
Thanks to the IT Help Desk staff!!!

  I called the customer at 806-8348885 and left the following message:
    This is  J.D. with IT Help Central calling for Ms. Brianna Parrish. Thank you for  taking time to provide us with feedback on your recent experience with  IT Help Central. We have received your survey and I am concerned with  some of the comments you've left. I would like to speak with you and  discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you  can contact me directly at 806-834-0780. 

I called the customer at 806-3003684. She is currently at work and cannot speak right now. She said she'd be able to call me back at 5pm today. I told her I'd be available from 5pm - 6pm for her call. 

 
   
  Scott, 

   

  I have reached out to the customer, Brianna Parrish. She was unable to speak at the time but will contact me later this evening. I have listen to the call as well as Tim Gary. The analyst, Dylan Brueggeman, gave accurate information but the tone of his voice was neutral and mono-toned through-out the call. I will confirm with the customer that this was the root of her dissatisfaction.

After a recent upgrade of Banner, credentials were questioned when I logged into
Raiderlink.  I had to click several spots to get around the certification check and
questions.  The last few days I have been able to log directly into Raiderlink
without the additional screens and checks.  An IT Help Technician called today to ask
whether I was still experiencing any of these issues.  No, I am no longer having any
problems.  I very much appreciate that IT Help Central contacted me a couple weeks
after initiating the request to be sure the system was working smoothly for me.

Thank you,
Laura

Dear Gale Stocks,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and made notes of areas where we can improve our service.I am most concerned about your rating for the technical skills of our analyst.  Please let us know in what ways our agent was lacking in this regard, so that we may better assist in this type of issue in the future.  It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services.

  I would like to speak with you and discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-6914.
   
  Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,

First, I have used the Help Central several times and have always had technicians who listened to my problems and worked with me to correct my issue.  They were always friendly and understood that my knowledge about computers was limited, so they took time to help me and explain what to do if I had the same issue again.   This time I had an issue with my calendar--my appointments had disappeared from my computer and my I phone. When I explained this to the technician, he replied, "I don't  know anything about calendars".  I tried to explain that when I "Accepted" invitations to meetings, they had always appeared in my calendar in Outlook, but they were no longer on the calendar on my  computer or my phone.  I was persistent and asked the technician how he kept up with appointments and deadlines and he replied that he used an app  "reminder".  I did not give up, so he finally looked at my computer and phone and asked me to show him how I entered items for my calendar.  He decided that I was in the wrong calendar and brought up my appointments.  I didn't know what he did, but I had my calendars back.  He tried a "test" and it worked with my computer and phone, so he sent me on my way.   
  
It is possible that I did not explain my issue very well, but the technician did not seem that enthusiastic about helping me and I don't think he would have had I not been persistent.  
  
My goal in the survey was to make sure that the people in the IT office were knowledgeable in all areas of computer assistance as I had experienced every other time I had been in with problems. 
  
Thank you for following up on the survey.

Mr. Hutton has been fantastic with all of the issues he's been assigned to help me with: he's 
always in a positive mood, quite knowledgable, is patient, and always happy to help.  He also 
doesn't just fix the issue, he talks me through the fix so that I'm learning and understanding as 
well.  I've noticed this is an upward trend in the past few years and he's very good at it.

I cannot answer this in reference to one person identified as "the analyst." Because 
these fields are required, I have simply marked "neutral." Ric Ramon was splendid 
in all respects and I am grateful for his good and kind help. Andrew Bevley was 
helpful and I also appreciate his good help.

Others were also involved. A conversation with Paul Hart was not only not helpful 
but led me and my very good psychology unit manager, Mark Hendley, to phone 
calls to Human Resources and the A&S Dean's office to untangle some of what Paul 
had incorrectly said. 

I do generally very much appreciate IT Help.

My issues were not resolved, but this was not the fault of the associate.  It was due to my last 
name and the possibilities for email addresses.  I would like my name to be displayed correctly 
with my email, but that is not an option.  The "display" name will always be Van-Sickle, but my 
LEGAL name is actually Van Sickle.  So, for all future events at TTUHSC or TTU, name tags will 
display my name as Van-Sickle.

There was also not another option for an email that would properly display my ACTUAL last name.

  I called the customer at 806-354-8571 and the person who answered said he'd relay a message for Caleb to call me. I called 806-674-4426 and left the following message:
    This is  J.D. with IT Help Central calling for Mr. Caleb Felton. Thank you for  taking time to provide us with feedback on your recent experience with  IT Help Central. We have received your survey and I am concerned with  some of the comments you've left. I would like to speak with you and  discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you  can contact me directly at 806-834-0780. 

I called the customer at 806-7423667 and was transferred to an office where he was available. The customer stated he did not receive an e-mail from Jorge Soto on 08/12/2016 at 3:15 PM. I advised the customer I would investigate and determine why that was the case. 

The e-mail was never sent as the agent who initially responded to his e-mail, Jorge Soto, did not check the box to send e-mail to the customer. I have called the customer back and apologized for the oversight.

Scott, 
  
The customer, Caleb Felton,  is dissatisfied with timeliness of the service provided. He is justifiably so as the agent who initially responded to his e-mail, Jorge Soto, did not check the box to send e-mail to the customer and as such an e-mail was never sent. 
 
 I have called and apologized to the customer for the delay. I will request Jorgeâ€™s team mentor review the process of sending e-mail to customers to ensure it will not happen again.

Please coach Jorge Soto. Jorge did not check the box to send e-mail to the customer and as such an e-mail was never sent. The customer gave us a negative survey on timeliness as a result.  Thank You.

First, the call-in system is annoying.  The phone systems asks for my R number.  
That should give the tech all the information they need.  But then, they ask for my 
eraider.  One of these 2 should be dropped.

In this specific issue, they could not find the problem.  I loaded a newer version of 
outlook and that solved the problem.  I could have done that on my own.  If they 
would have said, we don't know how to solve this; we suggest downloading and re-
installing the software from the start, it would have saved us all time.

Mr. John McGlone,
   
  Thank you for taking  time to  provide us feedback on your recent service experience with  IT Help  Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and  made  notes of areas where we can improve our service. The call flow process  you have described is understandably cumbersome and we have submitted an  alternate process for approval that would streamline it greatly.
   
  The technician advised that we would be able to work on your desktop computer at our Walk-Up Support Center to further troubleshoot Outlook without updating. We are still able to do this if you would like to use your preferred version of Outlook instead of Outlook 2016.
   
  Customer  satisfaction  feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement  of our  processes and service delivery. We thank you for your time and comments.  Please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,
   
  J.D. Campbell-Walker

TTU IT was able to help a little bit, but everything they suggested was all surface level stuff that 
I had already tried an considered prior to reaching out to them. I may not be the best with 
computers, but I did know to enable pop-up blockers, to try a different browser, and try 
different computers. Those were all suggestions that most people would consider before 
reaching out for help. Outside of those suggestions they didn't help me further. I was able to fix 
what I needed, but did so by going home and then reaching out to someone else that could 
assist me. I do understand that there are a lot of people seek help when it is not necessarily 
needed, but I would have appreciated a little more thought into ways to assist me.

Evidently, my most recent responses did not make it into the system since the claim is 
you have made "several" attempts to contact me. Regardless, I am in the process of 
relocating my computing resources since the ttu network and system is either unreliable 
or require we submit to a 'man in the middle' attack to establish a supposedly secure 
connection that ends up being either unusable because of speed, stability, timeout 
limitations or even raw functionality.
This is not a reflection paul hart or the other techs with whom I have corresponded but 
what now seems to be more related ttu's it policy decisions that are made and forced 
on us users without the due diligence of proper testing or even consulting with the users 
before implementation and hence the customer (us end users) and our ability to use the 
resources pay the price.

I called Dr. Mengyan at 806-8340503Customer doesn't like using eRaider credentials for SSH/SFTP authentication. He believes they are being transmitted in a plain text format and he also believe the credentials to get into his on campus resources (servers, etc) are also transmitted in plain text. Customer doesn't like the he can no longer use secure keys.
   
  He stated that the TTU SSH Gateway decreases the performance of his resources but understand that security must take precedence. He is unhappy that the SSH Gateway implementation was not communicated effectively and also that there was not time period where he could try out his setup with the gateway in place. He would like to see all major changes include a trial period where both services, old and new, are running simultaneously. He also stated he has or will move his resources off campus as he believes the security flaws are unacceptable.

Below is a very technical email, but it explains how passwords are used on campus. 
  
I might be good to read if you are inclined. 
  
Bottom line, the method that we use for eRaider passwords (SSH as well) is quite secure. 
  
 
  
Thanks! 
  
Tim Gary  
  
  
The asymmetrical keys used for SSH/SFTP (referred to as SSH) authentication are not used for the SSH encryption process.  â€œSecure keysâ€ used for authentication are not related to SSH encryption, and not using keys for authentication does not reduce or change the encryption used throughout the entire SSH connection. 
  
The SSH encryption process (both password and key based authentication) uses a combination of asymmetric (public-private key pair) key, symmetric key, and hashing algorithms that are exchanged using a secure key exchange algorithm.  None of these keys are known to anyone, but are used in the SSH connection process to establish encryption.  This key exchange and encryption process occurs before authentication takes place, meaning that all authentication is performed within the encrypted connection. 
  
In summary, the use of password-only authentication does not negatively impact the security of the SSH authentication process.  Passwords and keys used for SSH authentication are never sent in plaintext.  All TTU SSH gateway communication uses standards-based SSH. 

This will be handled by Tim Gary going forward. Closing issue. 

Closing. Report Completed.

Scott, 
  
I have reached out to the customer for service recovery. He is unhappy with the timeliness of the issue but he opened the issue then subsequently fixed his own issue and advised us to close it under 10 minutes. The issue was closed the next day after an inordinate amount of time but it was closed within SLA. 
 
 I will reply back if/when the customer returns my call/e-mail.

  I called the customer at 512-5477730 and left the following message:
     I spoke with the customer. He indicated that frustration came from calling IT Help Central and needing to wait more than 45 minutes to speak with an agent. When he was on hold for longer than 45 minutes without speaking with someone, he hung up and sent in an e-mail instead. 

   
 
Daniel, 
  
Does CIC log how long a customer was waiting in queue if the customer hangs up before interacting with an agent? I spoke with the customer that indicated he waited more than 45 minutes to speak with an agent before hanging up. Do we have the ability to confirm this?

I show two phone calls from that number during that rough time frame.  The first call came in at 5:53:01 PM and disconnected at 5:53:03 PM with a remote disconnect.  The second call came in at 5:53:55 PM, option 1 was selected at 5:54:33 PM to place the call in queue and was disconnected at 6:11:37 PM with a Remote Disconnect.  I do show the call was attempted to be delivered to an agent once at 6:00:33 PM; however, the agent did not answer the call.  It would appear he only waited 17 minutes and 42 seconds from the start of the second call till it was disconnected.

I was able to contact the customer Matthew Delmonico. His rating for timeliness comes from attempting to call ITHC but instead waiting 45 minutes for an agent before hanging up and sending an e-mail. I advised the customer that Iâ€™d investigate, determine why he was on hold so long, and apologized for the wait time. 
  
With Danielâ€™s help we determined the customer waited for an agent for 17 minutes and 43 seconds before he disconnected not the 45 minutes he claimed.

The fundamental problem here is not just the lack of quality response, but that IT
continually prioritizes making their own jobs easier over making their users' jobs
easier.  The change I am struggling to deal with never should have been made without
a clear understanding of how it would affect users, and without setting up processes
that were known to work.  Instead, we got this change dropped on us on short notice,
with no consultation, and with IT not prepared to deal with the fallout.

Scott, 
  
The customer, Professor Thomas Maccarone, is upset with the changes from the SSH Gateway and the lack of communication about it.  
  
The customer has already spoken with Tim Gary and voices his complaint regarding the change-over.  
  
The customer was provided with a solution and offered additional support to help implement it but had not done so in a month. The issue was closed and then a closed reply (That has not yet been worked) indicated he did not attempt to check the solution and â€œdo[es] not always have time to do it on your timetableâ€
 
 I have reached out to the customer for service recovery but I think Tim may be the best person to reach out to this customer again as he has already established a rapport.

I missed a call from Mr. Thomas. I called him back this morning.
     
  The customer indicated that his chief complaint is directed at the persons in charge of implementing the SSH Gateway:
   
    The SSH Gateway was setup without X-Window System forwarding  The gateway has a timeout feature that has no warning and no documented time frame  The implementation of the gateway did not seem to be tested with scenarios regarding off campus equipment  The implementation of the gateway was not communicated well to the people who actually use SSH  The Implementation of the gate way did not include a phase in period    He also mentioned the Service Desk personnel he initially spoke with had no knowledge of VNC over SSH whatsoever. He spoke with three people before he found someone to assist him and the troubleshooting techniques offered did not resolve his issue. I apologized to the customer for the lack of knowledge of VNC over SSH at the Level 1 support tier and offered to reopen his issue for further troubleshooting and to escalate his complaints to management. He said he'd already sent an e-mail to the CIO's office but would appreciate it none the less.

Dr. Austin spoke with Dr. Maccarone this morning. Dr. Maccarone indicated that the instructions we sent didnâ€™t work. Weâ€™d like to transfer this issue to Dannyâ€™s ownership immediately.  
  
Danny, can you please get in touch with Dr. Maccarone and schedule an appointment to work with him, before the end of the week? We could utilize our hotspot  to provide an â€œoff-campusâ€ connection.  Please report back.  
  
Thank you!

Analyst was polite, prompt, and worked hard to solve the problem.  However, because
equipment was missing, he could solve it during the class time.

At a meeting last week, we were told that ALL equipment was checked before classes
began and at least twice a week after - how, then, could some equipment be not
working because of missing parts the first day of class - this was a BIG classroom

appreciate the fact that he was not rude or snarky  about Mac computers is the way that some individuals had 
been many years ago. That attitude change in the people who are now working at IT Central is tremendously 
appreciated.

Payton  was absolutely wonderful and very very helpful. What I really appreciated about him was that he 
offered to do a three-way call to help resolve the situation. And I mentioned to him that it was about 10 
minutes before 5 PM and I was not confident that somebody would be willing to help me that close to quitting 
time.  He reassured me that e-learning people/staff would be most willing to help. And sure enough Karissa 
Greathouse came to my rescue.  If it hadn't been for Paytons resourcefulness to connect with e-learning I 
would have given up and maybe even canceled my class which I was loath to do.

  I called the customer at 817-496-4655 

    I spoke with Ms. Elena Hannush. She was upset the troubleshooting process because she needed to reiterate things that previous agent had already ask and perform steps that previous agents had already asked her to do. She felt that the agents troubleshooting needed to read through the previous issue notes.
   
  It appears that Jacob Kemp is using a template for browser troubleshooting. While the template is ok, it needs to be personalized a bit.
   
  I spoke with Dante about using bullet list for numerous posed questions.
   
  No one in the issue repeated their questions to Elena unless she did not answer them. The troubleshooting was not efficient but it was effective.

This issue was submitted over a month ago, but no one was able to fix my problem until Brian 
Pohl came along!  The other technicians only emailed me with possible solutions that did not 
work.  Brian contacted me when he saw my issue open, and he was able to fix it within the hour! 
As always, Brian's knowledge, excellent service and courtesy was top notch, and the DIDECE is

They fixed my upload speed which is good, but my initial request was about the internet speed 
itself. 10mbps is slow, and doesn't allow for enough bandwidth to do multiple things at once. I'm 
either doing homework, or checking my email. I can't do both. Even when doing one thing at a

I continue to be blown away by the extremely high level of customer service offered by the IT 
office. After our conversation, I thought I had ended the phone call and continued about my day 
when I heard the guy at the other end of line say "hello". He said he had been trained not to hang 
up a phone call on a customer. We laughed about after  I said I didn't have anymore questions. I 
was just impressed he remained on the line entire time after I thought I had ended it. Some one 
else would have hung up the telephone!  Keep doing what you're doing and thank you for

I have made contact with Ms. Petrie. She was going into class and will call back afterwards. At first glance there doesnâ€™t appear to be a problem with the issue.

Fortunately, I was able to lecture without total dependence on the powerpoint slides.  The analyst  
replaced the projector bulb immediately after my class which was perfect for classes coming after 
mine.  I guess ideally I will arrive at 7:30 in order to catch problems well ahead of the start time.

We had an issue with the time it took to fix the problem, around a week and a half to two weeks. As well with that three people tried to help but never telling us if anything could be fixed or what will be done. One even had us go to a site then realized we can't use that site as students.

Thank you for your follow up.

As you said, I ordered my transcript online.

I was not very happy with my experience with IT Help Central mainly because
they did not address why I can't order online even though I have the link
to order transcript on my Raiderlink.

If I can't order a transcript online because I am an alumni, I shouldn't
have the link on my Raiderlink account in the first place.

Regards,

Serkan

  As an alumni you may order your transcripts online but you must use an alternative method to do so. If you navigate to the following website: http://www.depts.ttu.edu/registrar/ordertranscript.php you will be able to order transcripts online. I do understand it is frustrating to have a link available to you in Raiderlink that does not appropriately redirect you to the correct resource. I would be happy to reach out to the Registrars office and encourage them to make a change to their system: as it is a system not maintained by IT Help Central I cannot make the change myself.
   
  To assist with this change I will need your R#. If you could provide this it would be greatly appreciated.

  Dear Hope Harris,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and made notes of areas where we can improve our service.I am most concerned about your recent experience with our Residence Hall Support. We are sorry the information gathered by our technician and Network Operations team have indicated that the issue is related to your hardware, but we must not rule out this possibility.  If you can test the TV's Ethernet connection on another network, then this may indicate that the problem is elsewhere.
   
  It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services.  Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery.
   
  I would like to speak with you and discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-6914.

Colby Powers was very helpful in getting this taken care of.  He contacted me 
almost immediately after I sent an email attachment for another ticket.  It turned 
out that the email attachment I sent was stripped by the system since it was a 
saved email.  Colby recognized this and had me email him directly to get the 
information in the ticket.  I really appreciated his assistance and good humor 
during our interaction.

Most of the time, I do not have any problems with IT Help Central. However, this 
time, for the first time, I experienced something I had not in the past.  I submitted 
my ticket and received a response from one individual who started helping me.  He 
asked me questions and I responded with the answers.  As I waited for a response, 
another individual responded to my ticket without looking at my responses to the 
first person; I was starting over with another individual. When I pointed this out, 
the response I received was the system was designed so other individuals can look 
at the ticket.  While that may true, the second person should have read my other 
emails and answered accordingly. However, the next morning, an IT technician 
came over and solved the problem. He was courteous and took the time find the 
solution which is why the rating for quality of service provided is satisfied (and the 
other satisfied ratings as well).

Susie called back.
   
  She is upset that the second person didn't seem to read the first person's notes.
   
  I checked the issue, the second analyst, Christian Arroyo, wanted her to work with her Primary Support Provider, he had indication from previous notes that the person she was working with was the PSP. 

   
 
Scott, 
  
The customer, Susie Land, is dissatisfied as she believes the analyst didnâ€™t read the issue notes prior to continuing correspondence. I contacted Suzie 09/29/2016. I explained to her that the second analyst she engaged with had indeed read the issue but didnâ€™t have the information sheâ€™d though he had. 
 
 The analyst, Cristian Arroyo, asked her to contact her primary support provider and didnâ€™t know the individual she initially reference as helping her was the primary support provider.  
  
The issue was escalated to Desktop Support and has since been resolved.

  I called the customer at 806-7305826 

    I spoke with Premitha and she was upset that the agent was not familiar with Mendeley software and the he did not google search to help find the answer. I informed her our agents are not allowed to google search an answer as the results could be inaccurate and cause unintended consequences.
   
  She was also upset that he continuously referred her to another person. I advised her this was because the other person would be able to assist where he couldn't.
   
  She was also upset that the e-mail seemed to take too long as though he forgot to send it. I advised her this was the case and that the agent already had been given appropriate disciplinary action.

The overall attitude and knowledge of the University Writing Center staff was outstanding. I felt 
very welcomed and was impressed by how the entire staff treated me as if I were an old friend. 
I was very nervous seeking help from the writing center because I am so self conscious about 
my writing , but now I will use the writing center every chance I get.

in but went out of his way to answer other questions I had to include searching for the 
answers that he did not already have.  The issue with my computer had been affecting 
me for a great deal of time.  My only regret is that I did not bring it in sooner.  Jerald 
also taught me some diagnostics that I can do myself.  Thank you.  I apologize if this

I dealt with many IT individuals over the course of trying to get my email problem
resolved.  Only Karisa Payne and whomever she worked with were helpful and got things
done for me.  I was unable to send email for over a half a month because those who
handled my case initially let it all slide.  I was anticipating the issue to be
resolved quickly due to the fact that it happened halfway through the first month of
the semester AND I COULD NOT SEND EMAIL TO CORRESPOND WITH PROFESSORS OR CO-WORKERS,
but it happened at a snail's pace.  It says a lot about your IT personnel that this
took so long to be resolved and I am extremely disappointed that it did not have
priority.  I kept getting the runaround and it was not until I spoke with Karisa that
progress really got made.  Sure my quota was increased on the first day that I
discovered I was unable to send mail, but it was apparently ignored that I still
could not send mail despite being beneath the new quota.  Karisa realized how serious
this problem was and went straight to the programmers she said, and I was able to
send emails within the day that I spoke with her.  She even went above and beyond and
made sure that I got back on the O365 server and could have all the benefits that
this server has over the on premise Exchange server.  To Karisa, I am incredibly
greatful.  To the other employees just collecting a paycheck, you should be ashamed
to have those kind of employees who do not do what needs to be done so we have basic
email service at the least.

Colton is a great employee and was delighted to help me! He kept me engaged in conversation while I waited

Chris, 
  
The customer cited â€œTimelinessâ€ as the source of their dissatisfaction.  Delays were due in part to the following: 
  
Â·         Initial request occurred on a Friday (10/07/16) after 5 PM, placed into staff queue 
Â·         Issue was not worked by staff until that Monday (10/10/16), wherein we sought confirmation that the email account was backed up and ready for deletion 
Â·         The customer did not respond to us for two days until Wednesday (10/12/16), at which time we clarified that we needed written authorization to proceed 
Â·         On Thursday (10/13/16) the customer provided the written authorization (4 PM), after which we then assigned the issue to Telecomm (5:40 PM). 
Â·         Because the issue was assigned to Telecomm after 5 PM on the previous day, it was not completed until the following day during standard business hours (10/14/16 9:46 AM) 
  
While it is possible that greater staff attention may have reduced delays, delays were primarily due to the timing of the customerâ€™s initial request and delays with the customerâ€™s response in supplying the confirmation needed by Telecomm to proceed.

I had John help me.  He was strong in communication and was also able to listen to me explain 
the situation as well as follow what was needed.  John was able to seek additional help to guide 
him in finding exactly what was needed.  Again, he had great customer service skills and fantastic 
communication.

Thank you for making Friday a lost easier and resolving the issue with me quickly.

I wish the first IT person was more proactive into helping me in my need. This is the second time 
it happens. I feel as if I have to think how I should be helped. The issue was fairly simple but it 
dragged even when I asked for a name. Next time, the IT person should be honest. If someone 
insists for getting help, they should do their best to make sure their request is met. Not just 
asking them to call their supervisor. Overall, the main supervisor helped me -- after  I insisted.

I had difficulty because when I tried to log into my computer it didn't tell me what the password 
specifications were, just that what I was using didn't meet the requirements.  It would have 
been helpful it at the point it told me the new password didn't meet the requirements, it had 
told me what they were or directed me to the e-raider site.  I don't know if you can adjust this, 
but it would have been a huge help and totally solved the problem without having to bother IT 
staff with it.

Based on the issue documentation, it appears that the solution was technically correct, but may not have been communicated effectively to the customer.  I called the customer and left a message advising that while we did not have a utility or indicator beyond direct observation, but that we can definitely work with Telecomm to get the information that they need.

My service experience with Karisa Payne was excellent as it always seems to be.  
She is a good communicator and that is my reason for the very satisfied ratings.


As always, I get frustrated with the indirect communication with a team.  Passing 
emails back and forth with an intermediary does not seem to be the most efficient 
way to process requests.

My analyst was very pleasant and patient with my questions.  I do teach on both campuses and have a 
LOT of difficulty between the two about who is responsible for what.  It is such a struggle and I am already 
limited for time as it is.  I would love to see the services between the two campuses integrated.  I will also 
vote for going with the TTU model over the TTUHSC model!!!  You all are much more customer oriented, 
more available, more helpful, and more efficient.  I am a huge fan of you all.

Thanks for the work you do.  It is appreciated and makes a difference.

Although IT did get things running 10 minutes into the hour, there was no human answer at 
either the main number or the backup at 8 a.m. I was left only with leaving a voice mail. That 
was disconcerting. The technician's first couple of attempts to cure the problem failed, and I was 
about ready to get my laptop and hope that it would work with the system so that we didn't lose 
the entire hour.

Brian went above and beyond when my computer freaked out. Not only did he solve the initial 
issue, but he also fixed a few other noticed issues, and answered all of my questions. He even 
killed a spider for us... an honorable task in an office full of women! :) 

On a separate topic... I was disappointed that it took over 6 hours for someone to contact me 
about the issue. In an email I received from y'all, I was told that it might take 8 hours to hear 
from someone, and that critical issues would be resolved first. I think the fact that nobody was 
able to log into my workstation was pretty critical. I lost almost a whole day of work, for an issue 
that was fixed fairly quickly. I was unaware that I needed to ask to have my issue set to medium. 
The lady I talked to when I called 742 HELP was not helpful. 

For the most part, aside from questions 3 and 5, my satisfaction ratings are solely for Brian, and 
how he resolved my issue.

Good Morning, Everyone. 
  
I discussed this with Brian Pohl & Ric Ramon this morning and have a few notes to add. 
  
Â·         The customer is the wife of one of our RHS students (Josiah).  Josiah reached out to Brian to get some advice on how he could help to fix the situation, but as a student he didnâ€™t have the ability to do so. 
Â·         Brian says the issue was actually resolved earlier than 4:30 but didnâ€™t get to update the issue until that time. 
  
I talked with Brian about some of the details not showing up in the description and timeline and that itâ€™s important to have that information.  Unfortunately, all technicians were very busy at the time, but we could have made a little more effort to contact the customer to see if we could provide a loaner until we could fix the problem.  Brian is aware and Iâ€™ll discuss this with other OSS Staff at our next staff meeting.

Chris and Andrew, 
  
For this issue I will give a brief rundown and conclusion â€“ all events occur on 11/07/2016 so only times are listed: 
  
Â·         8:49 AM: The customer calls in and notifies us of the issue wherein their computer needs to be rejoined to the domain.  ITHC frontline agent gathers all relevant information and creates the issue 
Â·         8:52 AM: Service Desk assigns the issue to Desktop Support 
Â·         9:32/9:40 AM: Brian Pohl flags the issue because the agent gathered the Service Tag as listed by Dell, not the Inventory Tag number. 
Â·         4:32/4:44 PM: Brian Pohl takes they issue then goes on-site to correct the issue. 
  
My conclusion is that the delays were not with the Service Desk and likely if the customer had been contacted and an appointment set when the Quality Flag was added, it would have set expectations with the customer regarding the time that would be needed to go on-site.  
  
The Service Desk agent will need to be coached on how to differentiate a TTU Inventory Tag and a Dell Service Tag to ensure accurate information is gathered every time.

The service I received was excellent.  There were two of us  needing assistance and 
the technician worked with both of you at the same time.  I was pleased with the 
resolution of my issue.  I even know what to do if it happens again.
Thanks

Ian Hooten and Ashley Prothro reviewed the call attached to this survey and will need to follow-up with the customer to determine if additional assistance is required and to apologize if needed. 

   
 

  
Chris, 
  
We called Cade. He hadnâ€™t had an opportunity to test the solution the agent provided yet. I assured him that if the solution the agent gave him did not work, that he could call me or IT Help Central and we could get his issue re-opened. I apologized for his experience and let him know that we will be providing coaching to the agent. 
  
Thanks,

Chris, 
  
Ashley and I reviewed this call and the customer cited in the ratings that they were displeased with the technical skills/knowledge of the agent which is corroborated in the call (attached) where the agent was not familiar with what a .ZIP file was.  The agent will need to be coached on how to identify certain file types or locate that information if unfamiliar. 
  
Ashley and I will contact the customer to provide service recovery tomorrow.

At first, this issue was just going to be added to the queue to be taken care of by 
staff starting today (Monday). 

I could not wait that long as I had a couple of assignments that had to be turned in. 
The young man helping me thought of something else to try as one final effort and 
very clearly talked me through it. I am extremely grateful to him and his willingness 
to go the extra mile when he did not have to.

Hello Chris and Andrew, 
  
For this issue the customer stated that the primary cause of their displeasure was delays. Here is a breakdown of the issue. 
  
Timeline: 
 Â·         08/30/2016: Call was taken by Daeland/Service Desk. Issue was assigned to Desktop. 
 Â·         09/08/2016: Ismael/Desktop contacted the customer. She stated that she would like to setup a time for Desktop to come out. He sent this to the shop techs to schedule an appointment. 
 Â·         09/09/2016: Sarah/Desktop called customer and left a voicemail. 
 Â·         09/13/2016: Caleb/Desktop called customer and left a voicemail. 
 Â·         09/14/2016: Alex/Desktop called customer and she asked that we close the issue. 
 Â·         11/14/2016: James/Service Desk received a call from the customer stating that the issue was occurring again. 
 Â·         11/17/2016: Sarah/Desktop emailed the customer the Service Desk 1st day follow-up template. 
 Â·         11/21/2016: Sarah/Desktop emailed the customer the Service Desk 1st day follow-up template. 
 Â·         11/21/2016: Customer contacted back stating she had not received any calls and provided her primary contact number. 
 Â·         11/22/2016: Trenton/Desktop called the customer and left a voicemail. At some point during this date an appointment for 11/22 was set between Trenton and the customer. 
 Â·         11/22/2016: Alex/Desktop notated that Trenton and Thomas went out and resolved the issue. Issue was closed. 
 Â·         11/22/2016: Customer called back stating that her email messages were sitting in her outbox. Benjamin/Service Desk assisted the customer with this and did not re-open the issue since he resolved this on the call. 
Conclusions: 
The timeliness rating was justified. The customer experienced significant delays from Desktop Support. Service Desk initially placed the issue into the Desktop queue and it was not initially addressed by Desktop until 8 days later. Throughout the life of this issue, whenever Desktop Shop Techs were doing follow-ups there appeared to be 4 day intervals between follow-up attempts which is at variance with Service Desk who attempts to follow-up within 2 days. Additionally, some attempts were made using email which was not the preferred contact method of the customer. The email attempts appeared to be using Service Desk form letters that indicate phone calls were made as part of the template even though no phone calls were made.  
  
It is possible that at two points Service Desk could have opened a new issue opposed to re-opening and re-working this issue. 
  
A heightened awareness with regard to stale issues and less dependency on email templates could have reduced delays. 
  
Thank you,

  Dear Ms. Fernandez Dos Santos Martins,

You recently contacted us in regards to images not being supported when using the Library Scanners and our means to assist with this were very limited. I am sorry that this was not what you were needing. Are you still experiencing the issue?


   
  I recommend using the equipment located in the ATLC (in the basement of the Library). They have staff on-site that can assist you directly with issues. 


   
  Also, if you need assistance with the main Library equipment, you may email libraries.ithelp@ttu.edu for assistance. 


   
  If you need further assistance in regards to this issue, or have any further feedback in regards to how we can improve our services, feel free to contact me at 806-834-8192.Sincerely,

Somehow it fixed itself...
There is an irony in the system and I am confident that you have experienced at other times. 
Specifically, my computer goes down and so does my phone and then you request a phone 
number. But I have no phone since the computer is down. Hmmm.

Thank you so much to Shadi Dissi, a student IT consultant who helped me get my 
computer reconnected to my Tech Share drive where my folders are stored so that I 
could work on a project for chancellor Duncan, President Schovanec, and Dean 
Zahler. He said that he would transfer me to a supervisor; however, I told him my 
issue which was that I lost my connection to the TTU VPN, and I told him that if he 
could help me, I would be happy with that. He agreed that he could. He was very 
helpful to me in guiding me through the many steps required in getting the VPN 
reconnected. He was thoughtful and encouraging, and I was confident that he could 
guide me to success. He did a great job! I told him that he was a miracle worker. 
There is no way that I could have done this myself.

I appreciate Shadi, who is a Mechanical Engineering student. He is an outstanding 
representative of the Help Desk and IT at TTU.  Thank you so much to Shadi and to 
all of you!

I had a very pleasant experience when I asked for help setting up my raiderlink
account. The gentleman who helped me was extremely knowledgeable and professional,
despite what I'm sure is a very hectic influx of calls this time of year. He gave me
exactly the information I needed and walked me through what needed to be done,
including giving me the phone number of which office to call to get my personal
information corrected on raiderlink.
Very pleased.

I contacted Dr. Dobrowolski and he stated that the main cause of his dissatisfaction was because he felt like he was ignored.  
  
In September, Dr. Dobrowolski, his NSC, our staff, and the spectrometer vendors worked together to identify that the best solution to connect his spectrometer to the network was to reserve an IP for the spectrometer. NOC reserved the IP and it has been working since. However, he recently had to replace some equipment in his setup and he now has a new hardware address. Since the hardware address was information we required from him in September, he assumed we would need the new hardware address to reconfigure the setup. He emailed us the hardware address on 12/19 but he also informed us that it appeared to be connected with the IP that was previously reserved for the previous hardware address. Dr. Dobrowolski did not provide any further context as to why he was sending us his hardware address. Our Student Supervisor replied to the customer asking if it â€œappeared to be connected properlyâ€ and if we could close the issue. 
  
This issue has since been re-opened and has been sent to NOC to ensure the current configuration will continue to work with his new hardware. Also, I believe coaching should be provided to our student supervisor in regards to asking more probing questions to gather a better context for the request submitted by the customer. Also some coaching in regards to looking into the customerâ€™s issue history would be appropriate. Looking into the issue history would have helped the Student Supervisor better understand the complex setup for this spectrometer.

The only reason I didn't request more help is because I have chosen to attend

This was the second time this issue came up, so I am a bit frustrated with that, but the service 
was excellent.  The only thing is that I randomly got a call from 742HELP, and the analyst on the 
other end was completely inaudible.  I didn't get a call back, so it was very unusual.

leaving open for further investigation into the comment. 

I am currently working with Brian to see if we can pull the call the customer is referring to. I called Kenny and he stated that it was a follow-up call to see if everything was working properly. He stated that he call sounded like someone was in heavy wind, but it was a bit more electronic "garbled" sounding. I asked him if he remembered if the call showed to be from 806-742-4357 and he could not remember. He stated it was a tech number. I am wondering if this might have been a call made by Telecommunications. 

I am also looking into the root cause of this issue. This happened twice to this customer and has happened to other customers in similar situations. I want to find out of this is a "known issue" and if it is possible that we should create a solution for this. I will be tracking the research of this separately so I will mark this is report pending.
   
  Also, we were unable to find the outbound call the customer was referring to. Brian and I ran multiple searches in CIC. This might have been an outbound call from telecommunications.

I called Ademide at 8574988909. Ademide did not answer but the voicemail picked up. The voicemail stated it was a number belonging to a Timothy. I left a voicemail stating that I was calling for Ademide and I left my number, 806-834-8192 to gather further information. 

 
  Dear Ademide Mabadeje,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and made notes of areas where we can improve our service.I am most concerned about your rating for Technical Skills/Knowledge of the Analyst.  It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services.  Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery.
   
  I would like to speak with you and discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-8192.
   
  Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,

I have attempted to contact this customer via phone and email to get further information in regards to the rating for Technical skills/knowledge of the analyst. 
  
Since I have been unable to discuss this with the customer, I have to make some assumptions based on the issue notes. The customer was provided accurate information, but one of the email contact attempts made by Jimmy Reimer/SD Student Analyst stated that we had attempted to contact the customer via phone when we had not. At the time of Jimmyâ€™s contact, we only had an email address on file for this customer. I believe this is the cause of the customerâ€™s displeasure. I have setup a time to coach Jimmy on how to properly use templates, including customizing them appropriately for the situation.

Timothy called me back from 857-498-8909 on 1/2/2017 at 5:35 PM and left me a voicemail. He stated that he got my message and that we could just tell Timothy whatever we needed to discuss and he would pass it along to Ademide. 

I called Timothy back and let him know that we were just calling to get some feedback from Ademide about an experience she had with our service desk and that his number was the contact number. I let him know that she could just reply back to the email if that was easier. He said that she did receive the email and she will reply back to the email. 

Jimmy Reimer has been coached on this survey. He is aware that he needs to pay better attention to the wording when he uses the email templates to ensure he properly caters the template to the situation.

I called Ms. Encinias at 806-743-3088 requesting that she call me at 806-834-8192 so I can gather further information in regards to her survey. 

 
  Dear Ms. Encinias,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division. It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services.  Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery.I am most concerned about your rating for Timeliness and Overall Experience. I do apologize for the inconvenience. At any point during the life if this issue, where you informed that TTU Staff would be on holiday from 12/23/2016 to 1/2/2017? Also, if you needed this access over this break, did you express the urgency of this issue? I am asking these questions so I can better understand the situation and do my best to coach the necessary representatives so we can provide a better service from this point on.
   
  If this would be easier to discuss over the phone, you can contact me directly at 806-834-8192.
   
  Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,

I was told that it would take longer due to the holidays, but not that TTU staff would be off from 12/23 to 1/02. I assumed they were off the same days that we were. I did inform them that I was needing this done by 1/3 so that I could submit my timesheet. When I called to check on the status yesterday, I was told that it was opened on 12/22, that nothing has been done since, and that there was nothing more that could be done because it was waiting on another dept. I was told that an email would be sent checking on the status, and it was resolved a few hours later.

Thank you Mandy,

The main cause of displeasure due to timeliness appears to be caused by miscommunication, inability to properly set the urgency of this issue, and amount of time the problem had been going on (problem started on 12/16 but was not brought to our attention until 12/22). 
  
Â·         12/22/2016 â€“ 11:54 AM: Eric Pope (IT Support Technician at IT Solution Center/HSC) emailed Robert Ward about an eRaider issue for this HSC customer.  
Â·         12/22/2016 â€“ 11:59 AM: Robert creates the issue. 
Â·         12/22/2016 â€“ 1:32 PM: Robert copies the email sent directly to him into the issue notes and assigns the issue to SD Staff. 
Â·         12/22/2016 â€“ 1:37 PM: Robert sends an email to Amanda letting her know an issue has been created and asks her to contact a staff member at IT Help Central for further assistance. 
Â·         12/22/2016 â€“ 3:06 PM: The customer calls the SD and speaks to Colter/SD Technician initially. She is then transferred to Ian Hooten. While speaking with the customer, Ian is able to identify the problem is not really an eRaider issue but an issue with the customer being able to access WebRaider. The customer does mention that she cannot access her timesheet. Ian states that she may not have been added as a valid user for this service and that he will request that she be added as a valid user. Ian mentions that we are 2 hours away from the beginning of a holiday period and he would increase the priority of this issue; however, he will not be able to give her a quote on how long it would take to be completed. The customer says this is fine and that she just wanted to make sure she would have access to it before the end of the pay period. 
Â·         1/2/2016 â€“ 8:13 AM: The customer called the Service Desk and Camden/Supervisor took the call. Camden told the customer that we sent the issue to another department on â€œ22nd of last monthâ€, and that the other department had not provided an update since then. She did let the customer know that we could submit a customer inquiry to get an update on this and that the other department should reply back shortly.  She then used the inquiry template in Footprints to get an update from IS â€“ Portal. 
Â·         1/2/2017 â€“ 9:13 AM: Alin/IS Portal notated the issue that this was now fixed. 
Â·         1/2/2017 â€“ 3:21 PM: Xavi emailed the customer to see if this was not resolved. 
Â·         1/2/2017 â€“ 3:45 PM: The customer replied back that the issue was resolved. 
  
As stated above, the problem had been reported to IT Solution Center before we were ever made aware of the situation. This may be part of the displeasure. Also, after discussing this survey with the customer, she did not realize TTU staff would be on break from 12/22 to 1/2. She thought we would be off the same days she was (HSC was only off the 12/23, 12/26, and 12/30). She needed to submit her timesheet on 1/2. If there had been further clarification/communication in regards to the exact date she needed this done and when we would be on break, the urgency in which this issue was worked might have been different. Also, when Camden spoke to the customer, she could have worded it in a way that did not make it sound like the admins had been sitting on the issue since â€œlast monthâ€. I will coach her on this.

Will coach Camden on 1/10 when she returns to work (she is off for vacation until then). I will process the survey after she has been coached. 

Camden did not come in on 1/10 after all (called in sick). Rescheduling our coaching session to tomorrow. 

I have coached Camden on this survey. She did not realize the breaks were different between HSC and TTU either.

 Subject: RE: IT Help Central Survey Submission ISSUE=29280 WKSPACE=14   
  
I have attempted to contact this customer to gather further clarification in regards to their rating. I have not yet received a response. 
  
Based on the issue notes, I believe the cause of displeasure is due to Camden/SD Supervisor misunderstanding the actual issue and attempting to troubleshoot a different issue. 
  
An international applied student emailed in requesting assistance with uploading documents for his application as well as setting his alternate phone number. He was unable to add an alternate phone number since he does not have a number with a US carrier. At this point he had already activated his account. Camden was under the impression that he was having issues adding his alternate contact during the setup process, but in fact he was trying to do this in eRAMS. If Camden had checked active directory, she would have known that his account was already setup/active. Even after the customer emailed in screenshots of him attempting to update his alternate contact in eRAMS, Camden was still attempting to gather information to troubleshoot an eRaider setup issue and re-send him an activation code. After 3 emails sent from Camden trying to troubleshoot an eRaider setup issue, I believe she realized what was actually going on and was able to properly assist him on her fourth email interaction with the customer. I will be coaching her on the importance of using active directory and viewing the attachments sent by the customer. 
  
Thanks,

I received excellent help from IT Help Central.  Both of the "helpers" went out of
their way to solve my problem.  Ali Hamud was especially helpful.  He took time to
solve what seemed to be a problem with no answer.  However, he eventually found a way
to restore my email. With much appreciation,

Josh Blount is very nice and smart!  I know you're going crazy with students coming
in, which is what caused the delay.
Original Issue = 525136
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = ITHC Service Desk Student Supervisor, ITHC Service Desk Student Technician 

I called the customer around 1:30 PM today. Here is some of the feedback she provided:
   
  Customer stated that Joshua Blount helped her and he is great but he is a student and isn't always available because he has class. She is used to working with Kyle and he is great. She was confused by Robert's email because she had been told previously that she shouldn't go straight to her Dedicated oss and has to open an issue with IT Help Central first.


   
  I am also adding some additional time to this survey because I had to read through two issues, and close one out since it was a duplicate.

 Cc: Gary, Tim ; Hall, Scott 
 Subject: FW: IT Help Central Survey Submission ISSUE=29407 WKSPACE=14
 Importance: High   
  
Since the main cause of displeasure was due to timeliness, here is a brief timeline of the issues: 
  
Issue 524452 
1/17 â€“ 12:24 PM: Customer emailed IT Help Central stating that word keeps crashing on her computer after windows updates were installed. She also wanted to know what to do with her computer after she retires. 
1/17 â€“ 6:58 PM: Rubisel/SD Tech emailed the customer asking if she had uninstalled and then re-installed word. He also recommended asking someone in her department about what to do with the compute rafter she retires. Issue status set to Waiting on Customer. 
Issue 525136 
1/19 â€“ 12:00 PM: The customer emailed in again about her issue. She did not reply to previous correspondence, so this created a new issue, 525136. She did mention that she can not get any work done because of this. 
1/19 â€“ 12:26 PM: Robert/SD replied to the customer asking if they had reached out to the dedicated on-site technician. He mentions that this would be the quickest way to get assistance.  
1/19 â€“ 2:05 PM: The customer emailed back stating she would try that again, but last time she asked there was only 1 person in the office and he said that she should call IT Help Central. 
1/19 â€“ 2:26 PM: The customer emailed back stating that they canâ€™t help her there. She said they were all out of ideas and that it keeps crashing anytime she does anything. 
1/20 â€“ 11:27 AM: Alvin called the customer back and she stated that the PSP assisted her. I am not sure who Joshua Blount is since he is not an ITHC employee. 
  
I believe the displeasure could have been avoided if we had done the following: 
Â·         Looked at the customer history and realized that we had already been corresponding with this customer. At that point we could have linked these and closed on per duplicate procedures. 
Â·         We probably should have called the customer to troubleshoot on the phone or gather necessary information to assign the issue to the customerâ€™s OSS. 
Â·         Not suggest that the customer to contact her OSS directly. The customer expressed that she was confused by this response because she had previously been told she should go through ITHC Service Desk first to get an issue started.

Original Issue = 523431
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = Matthew Zerrata 

Issue 523431
  Issue 524500
  1/11/2017 â€“ 2:16 PM: Kay/customer emailed in a request for assistance with her printer. It is displaying an error about closing the fuse cover. Customer states that he will be in his office from 9-1:30ish tomorrow. He also states that we can call him.
  1/11/2017 â€“ 2:25 PM: Brynn/SD Technician reassigns the issue to Desktop Staff. It does not appear that he called the customer to let him know what was going on with the issue.
  Â·         

Even if this didnâ€™t need troubleshooting, Brynn should have called the customer to update them on what was going on with their issue, or to gather necessary information for Desktop (TTU ID Tag?).
  1/11/2017 â€“ 4:06 PM: Matthew/Desktop Staff notes in the issue that he accepts it and that he will go out tomorrow.
  Â·         

Matthew did not go out the next day.
  1/17/2017 â€“ 2:11 PM: Zhanmig/customer emailed IT Help Central to follow-up on issue 523431. This ended up creating an additional issue.
  1/17/2016 â€“ 3:31 PM: Kameron re-submitted the Desktop reassign template providing further information about this issue provided by Zhanming.
  1/17/2017 â€“ 3:34 PM: Kameron emailed Zhanmig letting him know that we now have two issues for this problem. She stated that we will be closing 524500 and will continue to work on 523431. 524500 is closed.
  1/17/2017 â€“ 5:38 PM: Zhanmig/customer emailed back requesting that we please CC him on the case so he can follow-up on this matter.
  Â·         

Is service desk checking the closed replies?
  1/18/2017 â€“ 4:36 PM: Shania/SD SA received a call from the customer. The customer was calling to check on the status of the issue. Shania let the customer know that the issue had been reassigned to Matthew and that he would be contacting them to set a time to come out.
  Â·         

At this point, I do not believe the issue was assigned to Matthew since this appears to have been removed. Should Shania not have asked a technician to follow-up with Desktop/Matthew on this?
  1/19/2017 â€“ 1:27 PM: Rubisel/SD Technician received a call from the customer. Rubisel noted that the customer was requesting a status update.
  Â·         

Should he have not reached out to Desktop for an update?
  1/20/2017 â€“ 1:45 PM: Matthew went on site to resolve the issue. There was a paper jam. Once this was removed the customer could print. Issue was closed. 

I called Kay at his preferred contact number for the related IT Division Issue: 806-543-7215.

   
  I left a voicemail apologizing for the lack of timeliness with his issue. I thanked him for his feedback and let him know that it has helped us make notes of where we can improve our services. I provided my name and number in case he had any additional feedback or concerns. 

Dear Kay Arellano,
  Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division. It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services. Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery.
   
  I am most concerned about your rating for Timeliness of Service Provided. I have reviewed your issue and made notes of areas where we can improve our service. I would like to speak with you to see if you have any additional feedback. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-8192 or reply to this email.
   
  Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,
   
  Ashley Prothro

Action Items on my end:
    Meet with Tim and Rob to clarify the customer status request process.

  Coach Brynn. I have setup a meeting to coach him on this later today. 

I have coached Brynn on this issue. I have also met with Tim and Rob and they have clarified the process. I will now need to coach Shania, Rubisel, and Kameron. 

I have an appointment to coach the following individuals:
    Shania on 1/31

  Rubisel on 1/30

  Kameron on  1/30 

Coached Rubisel on this. I showed him solution 130603115739839 which gives him a description on how to handle customer callbacks about existing issues. 

I coached Kameron on this as well. 

I was out on 1/31 so I have rescheduled my coaching session with Shania for the 2/6. 

Setting the status to "Reviewed" to prepare for the upcoming monthly report. I have made an appointment to coach Shania on this.

To begin with I must admit that for various reasons I am ignorant to the ways of automation. My age, 56, and 
employment selections from the past did not warrant the need for computer skills. The gentleman who patiently 
guided me through this problem, was extremely capable. The issues were resolved by this expert and he went 
beyond the call of duty in methodically targeting the problem, and teaching this old dog some new tricks. Thank 
You!

I was very impressed.  Alvin Kim helped me solve my problem quickly.  I'd been 
struggling with it for a few months.  And although he couldn't log into my computer 
to do it himself, he allowed me to share my screen through Lync and show him my 
issues.  He guided me on the couple of the things to try and on the second try he 
fixed the issue.  Great job!

Joseph, can you please coach Shadi on leaving these types of issues as a waiting on customer status since they intended to come into walk-up? 
  
He is here from 6-10 today. If you do not get a chance to do this tonight, can you please ask David to do so? 
  
In regards to the Hotmail account setup, per Rob, we would at least attempt to assist with this so that part was OK.

It appears that the customer was dissatisfied with her experience since we referred the customer to her Primary Support Provider and closed the issue when her Primary Support Provider, Jimmy Kelly, had advised that she contact us for assistance. 
  
The customerâ€™s port is inoperable and ultimately the issue needs to be assigned to Network Operations. 
  
I contacted the customer and apologized. I also reopened her issue and gathered the appropriate information to assign the issue to Network Operations. She is temporarily up and connected to the network on a different port, but needs her designated port to be operable. I will coach Ivan on this issue.

Corey was very patient and helpful. Once we started talking about the issue I realized it was something I 
could have maybe figured out on my own. But I was very thankful to have someone walk me through the 
process correctly.

Hello Chris, 
  
Based on the issue notes, it appears that we provided the correct information and the customerâ€™s issue was resolved. I have emailed the customer for further information (we do not have a phone number for this international applied graduate student). 
  
The customer was emailing in for assistance in regards to uploading their transcript. We provided them basic information on how to do this, as well as suggest they contact the graduate school if she did not have the necessary tab in Raiderlink. We then let the WoC process take its course. Luke/SD SA did fail to email the customer after he placed the email in the issue notes. I will coach him on at the beginning of his next shift since we have a quality flag for him for the same process failure. 
  
Thanks,

I am going to touch base with him today just to ensure he gets it. 

I am closing this, I time tracked Luke Allen and found that he is emailing customers properly.

Solution not found - I prefer to use Google Chrome and IT person could or would not make this 
happen. Don't understand why I've used Google Chrome to grade/teach my TTUISD courses with 
this computer for 2 years with NO PROBLEMS but now I cannot.
Internet Explorer does perform as the technician suggested - just inconvenient when 
EVERYTHING else I do is with Google Chrome.

Hello Ric, 
  
I am reviewing surveys that have positive/neutral ratings if they provide mixed or negative feedback. While going over this one, I noticed that Matt provided instructions on how to add a trusted site in Chrome since he thought that might resolve her issue, but did not walk her through this over the phone or in person. Below is his reasoning. Is this accurate? Is this something Desktop should not support? I am also looking into why SD did not attempt to try this before sending to Desktop. 
  
â€œI also advised that our department does not support Chrome or Firefox to be used with our TTU domain webpages as they are third party browsers. Closing this issue.â€

I have also started two new solutions for this. A solution on how to add trusted sites in Chrome as well as an error solution. 

If Matt noticed this was not in the Knowledge Base, he should have contributed it per KCS UFFA.
   
  Also, I don't see that Bo made a phone call about this. I will coach him on this today (2/16). 

I did not get a chance to meet with Bo on 2/16. I have scheduled an appt to meet him on 2/21.
   
  The issue has been re-opened and the customer has emailed back stating she will try the instructions I provided her. 

Bo was coached on this. Also, Ric replied to the summary. Marking as reviewed.

  Hi Ashley, 

  Thanks for the information. I believe this customer is a distance ed teacher and may not have an actual office.

  That may explain why assistance wasnâ€™t provided in person. However, phone or remote assistance should have been an option.

  Iâ€™ll follow-up with Matthew to see why phone/remote assistance wasnâ€™t provided and/or if we asked the customer to stop by Drane Hall.

   

  Thanks,

   
  Ric

Not sure what you guys did on this one.  After entering my eraider ID and password 
to login to my computer this morning, a Bradford dialog box popped up requesting 
my eraider id and password.  I typed it in, hit ok, and the same box popped up 
again requesting my crednetials.  I repeated this scenario 5 times.  Then called IT 
Help.  While on the phone with you guys, I entered the id and password twice more 
with same results.  I then hit ok six or seven times without entering credentials.  
Finally a dialog box popped up saying "failure".  I then entered my eRaider ID and 
password again and the dialog box disappeared and did not return.

thanks for the help and I will let you know if I have any other issues.

I am going to set this to reviewed. I listened to the call and Alex probably could have asked a few more questions. However, the issue resolved itself on its own during the call while he was still researching the issue in askIT.

Madeline alerted me to the refresh button on my mouse, which wasn't working.  Alex 
alerted me to the option of logging on from a different computer.  As a result, my own 
computer is now able to delete from the delete file and to sign out.  I don't know why I 
had a problem, but it has been solved.

Ryan was great to assist me on the phone. I missed my deadline for my Excel sheet and
am now able to have a backup system in case I ever need it in the future.

This is the first time I have used office.com to download software. I think it was a
good learning experience for us both.

Thank you Ryan.

Here are my notes from listening to the call:
    Did you search the kbase?  Wasted the customerâ€™s time by having her try to download it from eRaider.  Also, instead of having her google Office 365â€¦ just give her the direct URL to office.comâ€¦      Solution 151130172434306      At 17 minutes â€“ tells the customer that he is not a hundred percent sureâ€¦ If you are following the solution you would have had a better idea about the screens she sees when going through this process.  The customer stated how this office.com area was different. She asked how long it had been like this and he said he was not 100 percent sureâ€¦ He could have mentioned how we changed to this platform.  Ended the call very well, let her know we are here to help her. Properly asked her to do the survey.  Didnâ€™t document who he spoke to for assistance. 

I called this customer and the negative feedback is mainly due to issue 528815. She had a report that was due and she was unable to complete it because Desktop did not come out in time. She made sure to emphasize that this should not reflect on the tech, she just understands that sometimes there are not enough people. I let her know that she can let us know the urgency of the issue so we can adjust that in the issue. Otherwise, she had great things to say about Keenan's assistance.

Hello Chris and Andrew, 
  
Please take note that the feedback in the comments are for issues 528867 and 528815. The main cause of displeasure was due to the timeliness of service for a problem that was reported on issue 528815. The customer made sure to mention that the technician that assists her is excellent (looks like Keenan/DT Staff has gone out on multiple issues for her) and that we needed multiple of him to help with the workload. I did let her know that workloads can vary, but we can prioritize issues based on many factors including urgency. I encouraged her to express the urgency when she creates an issue in the future.  
  
Timeline for Issue 528815: 
Â·         2/9 @ 1:18 PM: Customer called and spoke to Rubisel/SD SA. She was unable to edit certain columns in a Cognos report that she opened in Excel. After some research/troubleshooting, Rubisel recommended she uninstall and reinstall Excel and stated that Desktop could assist her with this. The customer asked if Desktop could assist her now and Rubisel said yes.  
Â·         2/9 @ 1:23 PM: Rubisel sent this up to Desktop Support. 
Â·         2/9 @ 3:52 PM: Keenan noted in the issue that he was moving the issue to his queue.  
Â·         2/10 @ 8:25 AM: Keenan went on site but the issue was not currently occurring. He noticed she had both office 2010 and 2013. He thought this may have contributed to the issue. He uninstalled these and installed 2016. Issue was resolved and closed. 
  
I will coach Rubisel on properly setting the expectation as well as prompting the customer for details that can help him better categorize the Issue Impact/Urgency. This would have helped us better express the urgency of the issue to Desktop. 
  
Thanks,

I have coached Rubisel on this. He took the feedback well and didn't realize he could use other options besides "medium, normal, normal, normal" for the impact/urgency.

work on the issues on my computer and was done in no time at all. He was very fast and very courteous.

Called Kaleb @ 702-526-7054 and left a voicemail apologizing and thanking him for the feedback. I let him know I was interested in getting additional feedback for his rating in regards to quality and technical skill. I provided my contact number, and let him know I will also be emailing him if it would be easier for him to reply to my email.

I have attempted to contact this customer via phone and email. The information provided to this individual from Ivan/SD SA was accurate in regards to the steps in which the customer should take. There were some inaccuracies in regards to how the NRAC process works, but I am not sure if this is something the customer knew and would have caused the ratings. I will coach him on this. 
  
The customer called in to see if he needed to re-register his PS4 since it is now connected to the TTU Res Hall wireless and he has experiences some performance issues. Ivan recommended that he connect his PS4 to the wired network for the best performance. The customer then asked if he needed to re-register the device due to the recent network changes in the residence hall. Ivan suggested he connect the device, and if it did not work to re-register it (will coach Ivan on this).  The customer then asked the process in which he would do this. The customer mentioned having to call and provide us information in the past to register a device. Ivan let him know that now individuals can plug in their device to the network port and leave it plugged in for an hour and the device should automatically register. 
  
It is quite possible that the cause of displeasure was due to Ivan not fully explain why he recommended the wired network for the customerâ€™s console and why the customer did not have to go through a formal process in which to register a console.

The response was fast and adequate, but I am disappointed in the policy. Many universities allow 
.edu email accounts for alumni, and I was hoping Tech would be one of them. This would be a

This customer contacted us because she continued to receive an error when she attempted to withdraw her application online. I believe her frustration was due to the fact that we continued to attempt to troubleshoot this issue opposed to withdraw the application for her. I emailed her providing admissions contact information, and SD staff has also provided admissions with the details of the error for further research on their end. They were aware of this customer and her request to withdraw the application. I do not propose any further action.

I have called this customer as well. I attempted to leave a voicemail but after hanging up I realized that the prompt said to press one after recording, not hang up. I will call back at a later time as to not annoy the customer. 

Setting to waiting on customer. 

I have coached Chad on this. No further coaching needed. He recognizes that we don't service that type of issue, and to get further information from the customer. 

After further discussion with Tim, it does not appear that Chad was in the wrong. We are curious as to why Matt did not at least try to assist with this issue. I plan to talk to Matt about this on 2/21. 

I also let Chad know that he was fine in referring this customer to walk-up so we could at least take a look at the drive.

Help me understand â€“ why would walkup not help a customer look at a flash drive to see what might can be done?  Often times corrupt flash drives are not recoverable, but sometimes the chance of recovery might be present. 
  
Lack of knowledge?  Lack of tools?

I just spoke to Chad about this and he acknowledges that he should have gathered further information before referring the customer to walk-up. Based on the information he gathered from the customer, Chad did not realize the customer was trying recover files off this drive, and he thought it might have been more of an issue with the computer recognizing the drive, or something of that nature.

Hello Chris, 
  
I have attempted to contact this customer via phone and email but have not yet received a response. This customer called us for assistance with an inoperable/possibly corrupt flash drive. He wanted assistance with retrieving the files off of his flash drive. Chad/SD SA recommended that the customer bring it to SD Walk-up. The customer came to Walk-up and was informed by the technician that this is not something walk-up could assist with.  
  
I will coach Chad on this.

Very good Ashley, and that makes us look better. 
  
So, takeaways are that SAâ€™s should not set an expectation on a fix, but that we can attempt to access the drive on another computer. 
  
 
  
Thanks!

I spoke to Matthew about this issue. It turns out that he did attempt to assist the customer. He plugged the flash drive into his computer at walk-up and was presented with the same symptoms the customer was presented with (an error stating he needed to reformat the drive). The customer did not want him to reformat the drive so he did not troubleshoot further. Matthew now realizes he should have documented this in the issue.  
  
Also, Matthew was under the impression the SA should not have referred the customer to walk-up in the first place for this type of issue. I explained to him that it is OK for an SA to refer a customer to walk-up for this type of issue as long as we set the expectation that it is something we will look into but may not be able to resolve. At that point, walk-up should be open to at least attempt to resolve the issue (which is what Matthew did). I also mentioned trying the drive on a Mac if he receives a similar issue. 
  
Thanks,

Ashley and I spoke, and I need to provide some more clarity on this. 
  
I donâ€™t have a problem with our agents attempting to help see if they can access data on a flash drive.  Iâ€™ve seen a mac access a usb drive that windows wonâ€™t, or vice versa. 
  
Iâ€™ll be working with Ashley on safety steps, how to word what we do, etc.

Corey was good, working through the troubleshooting. My frustration is that I called previously and 
was told there was nothing IT Helpdesk could do until I had my on site person conduct some diagnostic 
tests. When I called this morning with my onsite person to find out what helpdesk wanted done, COrey 
walked us through everything. The frustration is that there isn't anything we did that I couldn't have 
done myself when I called in the first place. Hence the Dissatisfied vote for Timeliness.

Hi Ashley,
 Thanks for the detailed report.
 I'll take the blame on the timelines of the issue.
 I monitor the TTUISD issues and reassign them to DT Staff or Students to take care of.
 
 I try to check the assignments several times throughout the day and missed this issue when it was assigned to TTUISD.
 
 I can make myself available if you have additional items you would like to discuss.
 
 Thanks again.

Since this customer marked â€œDissatisfiedâ€ under Timeliness, here is a brief timeline of the issue: 
Â·         2/21 @ 11:40 AM: Brenda emailed us stating she is getting an alert asking that she call Microsoft. No further information was provided. 
Â·         2/21 @ 12:07 PM: Rubisel/SD Tech emailed the customer advising that she run a full virus scan on her device. He also asked that she send a screenshot of the alert. 
Â·         2/21 @ 1:02 PM: Brenda emailed in the screenshot. 
Â·         2/21 @ 1:02 PM: Rubisel received a call from the customer. Rubisel attempted to troubleshoot with the customer but she stated that she is not tech savy and also let Rubisel know that she cannot open anything on the internet but can access her email and a few other items.   
Â·         2/21 @ 1:14 PM: Rubisel reassigned the issue to ITHC OSS TTUISD. He did set urgency to high and operations to medium. 
Â·         2/22 @ 8:43 AM: Ric reassigned the issue to Desktop Staff. 
Â·         2/22 @ 8:49 AM: Brian reassigned the issue to himself. 
Â·         2/22 @ 9:55 AM: Brian went on-site to assist the customer. He force closed IE since this was what was displaying the message. He also ran several scans but did not find viruses on the customerâ€™s system.  
Â·         2/22 @ 11:12 AM: Brian went back to the office and ran a scan with Qualys and found nothing. Issue was closed. 
  
I called the customer and she mentioned that it has been an adjustment not having an on-site person. The agent that she spoke to stated he was going to send the issue to Kyle Gibson but she knew he was no longer at TTU. From the customerâ€™s perspective, Rubisel made it seem like we would have someone on-site right away.  
  
After reviewing the issue and listening to the call, here is what I propose: 
Â·         Coaching for Rubisel: When Rubisel first worked the issue he did not attempt to call the customer. This should be addressed. Also, I had previously coached Rubisel on the importance of using the impact/urgency correctly. It appears that he did update the urgency based on his judgement on context clues from the customer. He let the customer know he had heightened the urgency since she needed this done immediately. However, this seemed to make the customer believe that he meant we would address the issue immediately.  
Â·         In regards to Rubisel stating he would send the issue to Kyle, should he or any of the other SAs be aware of OSS assignments and departures? Also, the customer mentioned that there are other IT people in her building and I think Rubisel was under the impression that these people were Kyleâ€™s replacement. This also led the customer to believe the Rubisel was sending it to one of those IT individuals and may have assisted in the misunderstanding of when someone would be onsite. Can we have some discussion on this? 
  
Thanks,

[Duplicate message snipped] 

After discussion with Tim and Rob, it looks like part of the error may have been to the PSP list still showing Kyle's name. This has since been updated. This may help alleviate confusion like this in the future. Also, after some discussion with Rob, we will not coach Rubisel since he did properly categorize the impact/urgency.

When I inquired about my issue late Friday night, I expected to wait at least a couple days or a week to get a 
response. To my surprise, I was very pleased and taken back to have received assistance the next day, on a 
Saturday morning. Great services! TTU students are lucky to have such an efficient IT department. Thank you!

Leaving open for Ashley to review. It appears no one worked this issue. 

Marking as reviewed. It looks like a customer sent a request to us and CC'd Michael Pekowski. However, Mr. Pekowski appears to have resolved the issue for the customer with out IT Help Central's assistance. Because of this, he closed the issue himself in the self-service portal in askIT.

Jacob did a fantastic job. My issue was complicated and Jacob was throrough, knowledgeable, and patient. He 
took the time to get insure he was not going to have to be back out for anything else by being proactive and 
foreseeing any future issues i might have from setting up the new computer. 
Your department is lucky to have him.

I really do not want to do the rating because there are so many components of this issue. In the 
beginning, Karisa was absolutely the greatest to work with, but the issue had to be pushed back 
to the college and they were not allowed to help because the computer was deemed as a research 
tool and not for teaching, which it is both. I have decided to take a different route to get the 
situation solved. But in the end, Karisa did everything she could and even more. You need a room 
full of people like her.

I called IT about my email not working because the memory was full. The staff 
member was friendly and helpful. We went through the flow chart of questions. 
When it was realized I would need a higher limit, she told me how that could be 
obtained. I followed her instructions immediately. It did take a day to complete the 
limit increase but it was accomplished and my work could resume.

Everyone was willing to help and nice on the phone but the issue did not seem very urgent to 
anyone.  I understand there are thousands of people who have issues that need resolved but 
this was for a dean who needed access to important emails while out of the country.  I was 
finally able to contact someone to get this marked as urgent and it was handled at that point.  

I understand the need for doing things as they come in or even doing this that are more 
important first but when administration is out of the country and needs that access to 
communicate or when they can't work because of a technical issue, it is important that those 
things be done more quickly.  Had this been me as staff or a student then I understand doing it 
whenever time permits but high level positions must have things working.

I do have an issue with the emails that come through.  They always say that I was unable to be 
reached by phone so they are following up by email.  Normally I don't get a call so I don't think 
much of it but today I was reached and did speak to the person and still got this email.  It 
makes it sound like I can't be contacted when I opened the ticket however that is inaccurate 
most of the time.

My questions to ITHelp central were not clearly addressed to communicate to the
Associate Director what was being asked for URL permissions. We both know that it has
to do with the ORS office but are not sure what will be unavailable if we do not
renew these permissions. We have decided to go ahead and ask for a renewal of the
permissions without knowing what they are for as we are not sure if we need them in
the future but do not want to be without them. If IT Help Central does not know the
answer to the questions we have for clarification this needs to be communicated
directly and clearly.

I agree with Ms. Perez. When the customer asked for better clarification of the issue, he just restated what he had sent her in a previous email. I have created a flag for the quality team to coach him on this. I am marking this survey as reviewed.

Called the customer at 806-742-3553. This call was a number that appears to ring to the entire Chemical Engineering department. No one answers and I was prompted to leave a voicemail for the department. This did not seem appropriate. I ended the call and then called the customer's student number @ 409-951-9724. The customer did not answer, but I left a voicemail apologizing and asking if the customer would like to discuss this interaction and/or provide any additional feedback. I will email him as well.

Hello, 
  
I attempted to contact this customer via phone and email but have not yet received a response. Based on the call recording and notes, I believe the cause of the displeasure was due to the issue being â€œpassed offâ€ between us and what appears to be two different Engineering IT departments. The root cause appears to be because we did not follow procedure properly when it comes to referring a customer to their PSP. After troubleshooting the issue with no resolution, we should have referred the customer to contact their PSP and then closed the issue. Instead, we continued to leave the issue open and emailed their PSP via the issue or let the customer contact who they â€œthoughtâ€ was the PSP. This may have caused confusion about who was working the issue, miscommunication, and delays. 
  
I will be coaching the following students on how this should have been handled (will reference solution 110923141904215): David Gutierrez, Kelia Smoot, Brynn Torres, John Balch, Matthew Hawiszczak, Cedisha Pitts. I will also review our training. It seems a bit odd that so many people would get this process incorrectly, unless something has changed and the knowledge base was not updated. 
  
I will also follow up with Madeleine Hogle. She was the person that initially took the call. She did a good with the initial troubleshooting, but then per recommendation of a supervisor (whom she did not document) told the customer that his computer was being blocked and she had to send the issue to staff to research further. I am curious as to how she came to this conclusion. I will also ensure she knows the importance of document who assists her. 
  
Thanks,

The employee (Nate) was very helpful on the phone through multiple calls (three) and 
volunteered to check on something on his own time when I had to get off the phone (I had to 
power down the phone to see if the phone was the problem). When I called back later he had 
been watching. He was trying to be helpful the whole time though overall it was a bit 
unsatisfying since we never really figured out what the problem was (clearly something was 
trying to auto-connect with an incorrect password and I was getting locked out of the system).

I had a few people contact me through email and ask me to do things that didn't make sense or 
had already been tried but I tried them again per their request.  I guess it is difficult to explain 
things through email and we weren't quite connecting.  I finally had Karissa Payne reach out to 
me today via lync and then called me.  She was great!  She asked a few questions to 
understand the issue and when she couldn't figure it out, she asked to call me back.  She got 
back with me within a few minutes and asked me to try something different (which no one else 
had asked me to do) and when I did, it worked!  She also called back before I had to go to a 
meeting to get this resolved.  She was very friendly and personable.  Thanks for helping me!

I will look into this one. So far I can tell that I need to coach Brynn and Camden because they are not calling the customer when working opens and requests.
   
  Will coach Brynn today and Camden on Monday. 

SD currently has a Global. I will reach out to her a little later today. 

I have coached Camden about always calling and emailing on opens and requests. She asked if she didn't need to do the 2nd day follow up, and I let her know that only applies to issues in a WoC status. Since the customer had recently emailed about this, it was back at open so the WoC follow-up would not be relevant at that time. 

I went over this with Brynn. I am marking this as reviewed.

Michael was awesome. Down before class even started â€“ did he teleport? â€“ and had 
everything good to go within a few seconds. My kids tend to panic when everything 
isnâ€™t perfect but when they see him come in the room they all relax and even smile. 
We certainly appreciate your teamâ€™s great expertise but we appreciate the kindness a
and patience even more.

Great job. And much appreciated.

He was difficult to hear on the phone because I could hear other people talking there too. That 
wasn't his fault, they probably need better headsets. He was very nice and helpful and was not 
offended when I kept asking him to repeat what he was saying to me when I couldn't hear him.

Thank you! the IT Help Desk at TTU is always great to respond to my needs. I 
cannot thank Ian Hooten and Monica enough for the assistance they provided to me.

I was working under a close time schedule on a multi-million grant for TTU. I kept 
getting messages about my Outlook being too full. I sincerely appreciate your giving 
me additional storage so that I could continue on with the project without being so 
concerned.

Ian went the extra mile to assist me.
Best wishes,
Elizabeth G. Haley

IT HELP is always attentive to requests to review suspicious emails.  As a staff
person, I cannot be sure which advertisements are scams or just annoying
solicitations.  I almost always send them to IT for review in case they are scams to
which others may be tempted to respond or even just open.

My notes for listening to the call:
  -answered call and verified the customer properly!
  -When you play back the part where he is looking for a solution there is 30 seconds of "um, hmmm" etc etc until he decides how he wants to proceed.
  -If the customer does not see the option you are looking for, you can have them read out what they see. They might be on a different page. 
  -Noted in the solution that you tried resetting citrix and refreshing the apps. He did not put that he was unsuccessful doing this or add a solution on how to do this.
  -Also, it is handy to link the solution you tried.
   
  Will have someone create a solution on how to reset citrix receiver in macOS (assigned to Hannah).
  Should we have a list of who manages what application if basic citrix troubleshooting doesn't resolve the issue? Luke knew it was COE but I wouldn't have known that. 

I called this customer and he was most frustrated at the fact that we did not have any citrix support for macOS. I will work on getting this added. I have assigned it to Stephenie instead since she has less task compared to Hannah.

  KCS â€“ Yes.
   
  May also be a learning opportunity for Luke on how to handle situations when we donâ€™t have a solution. I commonly donâ€™t know the answer, but instead of fumbling around I will tell them customer, â€œLet me do some research on this and get back with you.â€ Then, get an idea of the urgency, update the issue, research, create an askIT solution, and get them the solution details. We have Macs available that the techs and above can use to research when the SAs send up issues; the SAs donâ€™t have to solve everything themselves. Goes back to this: https://www.depts.ttu.edu/ithelpcentral/intranet/pandp/customer-support-model.php. Send up, let techs and above find solution; they will then contact customers, update askIT, etc. so that the SAs have the answer the next time.

  I called and spoke to this customer. He expressed that much if his rating had to do with the fact that we didnâ€™t seem to know how to troubleshoot the Citrix receiver on a Mac. The agent that assisted him could only find solutions on how to troubleshoot the Citrix receiver on Windows. He attempted to have the customer reset his Citrix receiver using the Windows instructions but was not able to. Ultimately, the customer was referred to College of Engineering since this is an app they manage. From what I understand, this is where we would refer the customer if basic troubleshooting did not resolve the issue.
   
  I have assigned one of the KM students to create solutions to provide basic troubleshooting for the Citrix receiver on a Mac. This will include how to reset the receiver and how to reset the apps.
   
  The quality team will coach the agent that handled this situation on better ways to work with the customer when you canâ€™t find a relevant solution (for example, since the customer did not seem to have the same options that Luke/SD SA had on his solution, Luke could have asked the customer what he saw on his screen to see if there were similar options).
   
  Also, I would like to continue the discussion of how KCS would come into play for this situation. Should Luke have started a solution for this issue that someone else would complete since he didnâ€™t know the resolution?
   
  Thanks,

It always makes me happy when I have an issue that isn't a common fix, as I means I'm not 
wasting the time of the IT personnel by asking for something I should be able to handle myself. 
Yesterday was one of those days, and Zack found the problem quickly and fixed it quickly as 
well. And also suggested pointers on ways to keep learning computer skills, which I'm grateful 
for as well.

As always, Zack came through for me with flying colors. This is the second time my
Mac - under warranty - has "blacked out." Zack promptly took my Mac, ordered a new
logic board and power source (by communicating with Apple), handled the warranty
issues, fixed my Mac, and brought it back to me. He then stayed to make sure
everything was loaded correctly (there were some issues), checked my Outlook,
reinstalled and tested the printer driver,and basically made sure I was in tip top shape.

Zack has great customer service. He's easy to talk to, answers all your questions,
and really gets to know you as a person. I am so grateful we have someone like him
working at Tech who goes above and beyond with our Macs. Thank you!  - Brandi

I think it would be much better if you provide a title of technical problem along with the issue number.
Because when there is multible of open cases and number, it is hard to go through the case or problem and the 
numbers.
So I know what case you are referenig to.
Thank you

Alvin brings up a good point about how busy it gets in Walk-up Services and how it can be difficult to document issues properly. I would like to make sure we are training the Walk-up agents appropriately to get more help if they need it so they can thoroughly and clearly document issues. If we need to consider increasing student resources by way of scheduling and hiring, we would need to do so to ensure the proper level of service that we expect, which includes documentation in FootPrints. 
 
Thanks, all!

I called Alvin into my office and spoke to him about this issue and why we were asking. 
  
He relayed the events to me how it went and honestly, nothing significant was stated other than the customer was upset with Best Buy for the computer he purchased and the issue he was having. 
  
I did discuss with him the other options we could have tried or that staff may have need to be involved to assist his especially since he stated the room was quite busy at the time. 
  
Alvin is one of my better student workers, as we all have seen by his positive survey and thoroughness in correspondence in his issues. I would like to think this is a learning experience that will give him more tools in his tool box to assist customers in the future. 
  
Please let me know if you want me to investigate further or do any further coaching with Alvin.

Good Afternoon All, 
  
First of all, I apologize for the negative survey. I regret that I was not able to assist him to his satisfaction. 
  
Unfortunately, I cannot recall what exactly happened because this day just happened to be very busy. I did not do a good job filling the issue out in detail, as I had more customers walking in, coincidentally, with similar issues. I was backed up on issues at one point. I will make necessary improvements. 
  
From what I remember, the customer walked in without calling us. He seemed frustrated that he could not use the computer at this time of the semester so I did my best to assist him. I tried turning his computer on, as I do with all walk-up issues, and at one point concluded that there is not much that ITHC could do without violating our policies. I do not recall what brought me to this conclusion and I wish I could follow up with him to get a better idea, but that does not seem to be an option at this point.  
  
All I could remember from this issue is that he understood that there is nothing more that we could do for him and that he left on a good note. If I saw any sign of dissatisfaction, I would have introduced him to a staff member.  
  
I did notice some customers walking in with black screens after speaking with an agent over the phone. It seems that some agents refer the customers to walk-in without much assistance for black screens, but they often realize that we cannot do much until they come to walk-up. 
  
I will visit with Robert as requested. Please let me know if you have any questions. I will be at walk-up until 6:30PM today. 
  
  
Thank you,

Did he just show up at our Walk-up Services location, or did he call first? I'm wondering if we need to talk to the agent who initially talked to him on the phone and make sure they know to clarify this information before referring someone to Walk-up Services. If I remember correctly, the knowledge base clearly says that agents are supposed to do that when we are on the phone with someone and refer them to Walk-up.

I called Jacob on the phone number listed on his account (FP address book field â€œStudent Phoneâ€). However, this was his home phone number and his mother answered. I asked to speak to him but his mother stated he was in class. However, she was aware of the situation and did mention that he was frustrated because he was not aware that we could not assist with issues if the computer could not boot up. She was wondering if there was any clear and obvious documentation that we cannot assist when a system is completely dead. She wondered if this was documented in â€œbig bold lettersâ€ or in some fashion so her son was not under the impression we could assist with this. She also mentioned this was particularly dissatisfying because he has no computer and finals are coming up. I left his mother my contact in case Jacob cared to call me back and follow-up further. She did not provide me his number and stated it would be no point emailing him since he did not have a computer (I did not ask if he had email on his phone as I figured that might sound combative).  
  
Also, I am curious if the technician working walk-up even attempted to look at the computer, try and boot into safe-mode, etc. We might want to follow-up with Alvin Kim on his next shift to get further information.

The analyst who assisted me was amazing. My issue was with OneDrive refusing to upload a file, and 
he very patiently explored various possible causes of the problems. He did not rush me at all, and he 
carefully explained every step he wanted me to try on my end. 

I would have written me off as an ignorant user long before he solved my problem, but he never made 
me feel dumb, he never made me feel the need to rush. At one point while we were waiting to see if it 
worked I offered to sign out and call back if there was a problem, he said no and stuck with me. Just 
seconds later the file rejected, and he tried another solution. 

I've gotten amazing IT service over my many decades at TTU, but this was probably the best IT phone 
service I've ever had. 

Thank you so much. His first name was Joshua.

Luke was awesome! Helped me with my issues and was very kind, polite, and patient. I hate 
calling services for help because it can be such a pain but this time was less painful. Great 
costumer service skills, needs a raise, etc. Keep him around. Thanks.

5/5/2017 at 4:53PM: Customer called in reporting that he could not log into RRO, would be redirected to eRaider Account Management page. Ivan found a Knowlege Base solution for the issue and performed asked the customer if he had performed browser troubleshooting, which he had. Ivan then skipped the next step, which was to set up a VPN and directed the customer to Transition & Engagement as per the solution. 

 
    [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:06 PM]  

  Hey are you working on issue 540064

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:06 PM]  

  ?

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:07 PM]  Payne, K:  

  Yes, I called him back and fixed the issue.

  Waiting for hiim to call back to confirm

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:07 PM]  

  Interesting! I just got back from the training. Did you see the survey or did he call back?

  And what did you do?

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:09 PM]  Payne, K:  

  I saw the survey. It doesn't look like the SA did any troubleshooting with him on the phone. So I did that first, browser, VPN, etc. I called the RRO office and they were hesitant to help and said to talk to us... lol. I pushed them and they found a problem with the customer account. She fixed it, so now we just have to wait to make sure its fixed. All the information is in the notes.

  Issue is reopened, WOC

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:10 PM]  Payne, K:  

  I helped because I had an issue like that not too long ago and I had the fix.

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:13 PM]  

  Thank you!

   

  [â€Ž5/â€Ž10/â€Ž2017 3:13 PM]  Payne, K:  

  Youre welcome. 

Ashley's note when listening to the call:
    gathered eRaider and verified account

  Did not put in the issue notes that the customer used two different browsers. Also did not note in the issue that he only went through part of the solution. Also did not note that the customer had tried multiple computers (including one on campus).

  Did not put in the issue notes that the customer also tried a mobile phone. 

  At this point I would rule out a browser or VPN issue personally. 

  Also, we told this person it wasn't an account problem but a browser problem since he could login to eRaider. However, it was an account issue (on the RRO's end). 

I sent the summary, I called the customer and apologized, and I have flagged the issue so Ivan can be coached on the following: 
   
  There is a point in the call where the customer believes the issue is with his account. However, Ivan tells him that if he can login to eRaider it is not an account issue and it is most likely a browser issue. However, the customer has tried multiple browsers, multiple devices, and on those same devices that failed for him, his friend was able to login and register. Based on these symptoms, it is pointing towards an account issue (on the RRO side of things). Can we please coach Ivan on how to best problem solve issues related to web apps? How to identify if the issue may be with the webpage - see if you can replicate the issue (granted I know Ivan couldn't replicate this issue since he is not eligible for RRO, I am only mentioning this as a general troubleshooting step if possible). How to identify if the issue may be with a browser - other people cannot replicate it, it works in some browsers, clearing cache/cookies resolves issue. How to identify if this is an account issue - if other users can access the site on the same device/browser.


  


  Also, there were instances where Ivan could not understand the customer (around 6 minutes into the call). I would recommend apologizing and then asking them to restate. When he summarized the issue he kind of made it seem like he thought the customer was able to login after all "can you login on your friends computer or not..." which can possibly come off as discourteous.


  


  The issue notes do not fully contain the symptoms that the customer described (how he had tried multiple browsers, computers (including a computer on campus). He also did not put in the notes that he did not setup a VPN. He just linked the solution he was using without specifying what he did/did not do.

Customer called stating he could not login to the RRO website. He initially called RRO but they suggested he call IT Help Central. The customer had tried different browser, different computers (including one on campus), and his cell phone. He stated that his friend could login to the site and sign up for orientation on the same devices. Ivan/SD Tech went through solution 110923113609994 and walked through all of the steps except setting up a VPN. This solution goes through steps that point towards a browser issue. However, based on the customer feedback, it doesnâ€™t seem like a browser/computer issue. Also, if the customer had tried this on campus, there would be no point in trying the VPN. This lead Ivan to the last step of this solution which suggests the customer call Transition and Engagement for further assistant. He then closed the issue and the survey was submitted. 
  
Karisa/SD Staff saw the survey for this and called the customer back. Based on the issue notes, she did not think Ivan did any troubleshooting so she went through basic troubleshooting. When this failed, she called the RRO office herself. They were hesitant to look into the issue, but with Karisaâ€™s persistence, they did look into the issue and realize something was not set properly for this individual to sign-up for orientation. The RRO office corrected this, and the issue was resolved. 
  
I have called the customer and apologized, but he did not give much detail in regards to his rating. I believe much of the rating is due to the overall experience of being passed back and forth. However, I believe Ivan could have handled the situation better. I believe Ivan had a hard time understanding this customer, and there was an instance where he thought the customer was saying he could login. The customer also stated that he thought this was an account issue based on his symptoms but Ivan told him he thought it was a browser issue because the customer could login to his eRaider account just fine. I think Ivan should be coached on how to best isolate the issue (whether it is a site issue, browser issue, or account issue) and how to best word responses when you donâ€™t fully understand what the customer is stating. 
  
Thanks,

the issue. Seems local and Lubbock eraider use different addresses which my browser could not id therefore my

I listened to the call. Here are my notes:
   
  Did not put the new number in the alt-contact field and set preferred contact. 
   
  Renee said she would email the link... However, she emailed her issue notes instead of saving the issue notes and then sending a professionally composed email to the customer with the link (or link to the solution).
   
  The customer asked if she came by could we help out, and Renee stated we could but it would be hard because we are not there (meaning the res halls). She could have stated that the customer stop by a res hall support area. This may have been a better alternative. 

I called this customer to get feedback about her ratings. I also apologized. Here are some of the notes from the call:
   
  Tatum mentions that Renee would not tell her the password, and then she said she was going to send her a link to a link. However, she never received this.


  


  She mentioned that she ended up getting the password from her friend. Her friend states that the passwords are posted in the chitwood halls. However, she is in talkington and it is not posted there.

I have called this customer and apologized. She provided additional feedback in regards to her ratings. She stated that Renee would not give her the password to the Res Hall Wi-Fi over the phone, and she was supposed to send her a â€œlink with a linkâ€ to access the password. She also stated that she never received this email (FootPrints shows that it was sent). However, her friend just told her the password, and her friend stated that it is posted all over Chitwood hall. She is in Talkington. I let her know that it is policy that she login to access the password, but that I would investigate why this was not sent and pass along her feedback.  
  
In regards to the issue, Renee did not create a professional email to send to the customer. She simply emailed the customer her initial issue notes (that did have the correct solution linked). I believe she should be coached on this. This is the second time within the past two days I have heard a customer mention that they did not receive an email that shows to be sent from FootPrints. We may need to investigate further. Since this customer was already upset about the service, I did not think it appropriate to see if she could re-check her mailbox. I will reach out to the other customer that mentioned this issue to research further. 
  
I also submitted this customerâ€™s complaint about us not being able to provide the password over the phone in the complaint/suggestion portion of the issue.

The IT Help Desk representative I spoke with was very kind and helpful. I 
am well lets just say an older technologically challenged individual and 
this young man, wish I could remember his name, was so nice and patient 
and did not seem irritated with me at all. He was also very helpful and 
answered all my questions that didn't even really relate to the issue at 
hand. He did a great job and definitely deserves some kudos for his job 
performance!!

I have also emailed Randall to see if he knows where the NRAC profile spreadsheet is. AVG 2016 is not on the spreadsheet in the K-Base so it is interesting that it passed one scan but not the other. We may need to reach out to security. 

I reached out to Kent Towns who referred me to Randall Osborne. However, Randall did not reply. I have my student testing this on our medium NRAC test port here at IT Help Central. I have also made a note to follow-up on this to ensure the spreadsheet is accurate.

I called and emailed the customer, but did not receive a response. I apologize for the delay, I am still trying to get some details on whether AVG 2016 is something that should pass Access Control on a medium port. Here is a timeline of the issue:   04/13/2017 8:49:46 AM Michael Nzoiwu(Customer):  Customer emailed because they are failing NRAC scans due to not having an Anti Virus, but he has AVG. 04/13/2017 10:17:54 AM Alexander Relli(Supervisor):  Advised the customer to go to RHS Walk Up. 4/13/2017 12:08:42 PM Joseph Walker(RHS Technician): Contacted the customer via phone and email and set a follow up date. 4/15/2017 3:49:56 PM Koffi Yao(RHS Technician): Customer called and was advised to bring his desktop to their walk-up support.  4/18/2017 10:36:42 AM Josiah Hamilton(RHS Technician): Customer was called but was unable to be reached. Customer was also emailed and the issue was changed from Open to WOC. 4/20/2017 10:01:07 AM Josiah Hamilton(RHS Technician): WOC 2 email was sent. 4/22/2017 4:35:19 PM Koffi Yao(RHS Technician): WoC 3 email sent and phone call. At this point it was stated that the number was not in service. Issue was closed. 4/22/2017 6:33:11 PM Michael Nzoiwu(Customer): Customer emailed back that they are still experiencing the issue. 4/24/2017 8:11:30 AM Kirby Mackey(RHS Technician): Reopened issue. 4/24/2017 10:37:11 AM Josiah Hamilton(RHS Technician): Emailed the customer informing them that they set the follow up date for a couple of weeks to give the customer time to come into the office. 5/08/2017 10:09:12 AM Nicholas Alvarez(RHS Technician): WoC 2 email sent. 5/08/2017 5:20:39 PM Michael Nzoiwu(Customer): Emailed back that he is still having the problem. 5/09/2017 10:20:53 AM Josiah Hamilton(RHS Technician): Emailed the customer that it appears his connection works since he was able to email RHS back. 5/11/2017 10:17:30 AM Josiah Hamilton(RHS Technician): Emailed WoC 2 template. 5/11/2017 11:37:46 AM Michael Nzoiwu(Customer): Emailed that his issue is resolved. 5/11/2017 Nicolette Carver (RHS Technician): Closed issue. 
No troubleshooting was done at Service Desk. This is something that we could have assisted with over the phone. Alex Relli no longer works at IT Help Central so we cannot coach him on this. 
  
As you can see, after it was sent to RHS, the customer was not very responsive to RHSâ€™s attempts to contact him. However, when I called this number it stated that the number was not in service. This was also identified by Koffi Yao on 4/22. It might have helped us make contact if we had asked for a phone number in one of the emails we sent to him.

The service I received was exceptional; thank you.  The solution to my request for 
remote accessibility solutions was unilateral.  I believe that I would like to see multiple 
solutions of software for considerations of business requests in the future and I would 
encourage the IT division to review their flexibility in tandem with security in 
evaluating solutions.  The solution to my problem lacked the flexibility of choice for my 
needs and I feel that this is not acceptable.

I thnk Wyatt was probably the best analyst I have ever talked to at the Help desk. He was 
prompt, had great phone skills, knew his stuff, and was just simply reassuring, which for those of 
us who have a problem is a really big deal. Kudos to him, and many thanks! JH

I have attempted to call and email the customer and have not yet received a response. 
  
5/16 at 3:34 PM: Customer called IT Help Central and spoke to Zarka/SD SA. He wanted to bring his previous graduate studentâ€™s laptop to us to wipe in preparation for his new graduate student. Zarka said he could bring this to SD Walk-up. 
  
After this call, the customer brought the laptop to walk-up but we told the customer we could not assist since it was a TTU provided laptop. We referred the customer to COE IT but did not close the issue (Stephenie/SD Supervisor).  
  
Quality will coach Zarka on identifying if the customer is having issues with TTU provided equipment or personal equipment before referring them to walk-up. Also, if the customer was wanting to reformat/re-install windows, this is also something we cannot do at walk up. In other words, we will review solution 110923135457595. 
  
Also, per solution 110923141904215, we should have closed the issue after referring the customer to COE IT. We will coach Stephenie on this as well. 
  
Thanks,

He was able to fix a problem that others were not, because he invested himself in the issue and 
thought of other ways to fix it than just the IT side. 
He stayed on the phone and kept trying to think of fixes when other IT helpline people told me

Hello Beatrice,
   
  Per our phone conversation, here is my contact information:

Here is my call history with Beatrice. 
  I called her and left a voicemail on 6/6. She called me back around 11:30 AM on 6/8. I call her back and left a voicemail. Around 2:05 she messaged me via IM to call her when I was done with the call I was on.
   
  I called her back and here is the additional feedback Beatrice provided.
  First of all, Beatrice was inconvenienced by not being able to do her work for an entire 8 hours. This put her behind and the next day was rough catching up. She believes we should have a system where when someone is trying to get back into her computer, she should not have to utilize other individuals to assist in the process. Since she could not get into her computer to access the code sent to her email, she tried to use a laptop. However, she couldn't use that because she could not get on wifi, so she had to inconvenience her co-worker to reset her code. And while doing this she continued to run into problems. She also suggests that the person that she deals with initially should be the person to assist her throughout the life of the issue. She felt like she was passed around.

Ashley, 
  
Given that I don't know what those are, I assume that I'll need to talk to you at length about it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). That being said, I'll have to do so either this evening (I come in at 4:30 for test calls, but I could try and make it a bit early) or during one of my training shifts; we're pretty short on hands up here (I'm the only non-SA that will be here before 3pm). 
  
Thanks, 
Sam

That is a good idea. I donâ€™t think we utilize that troubleshooting method often enough. I will work on getting more content about cached credentials in training.

Could we have asked the customer to disconnect her Ethernet cable so her system would use her cached credentials instead of authenticating? 
  
This would have at least let her into the system and then she could have reconnected her Ethernet cable to get access to the eraider site.

I like the chronological timeline approach a lot, Ashley. Thanks, and great summary. I know this took a lot of work. And we appreciate you coaching our students. Setting impact and urgency appropriately is something I want to emphasize more with our students and staff. 
  
Iâ€™ll let Ric or Andrew answer your question highlighted in yellow. I donâ€™t know what the impact would be to their operations to take on those types of issues. 
  
With regard to the customerâ€™s concern about bothering co-workers or people in another department, and those people being concerned about signing in to her computer: This is a valid point and much more important now that ADFS is deployed. If you sign in to someone elseâ€™s computer, they can just open Chrome or IE, go to a website, and sign in as you. To fix this, I wonder about the technical feasibility of making any customer computer into an eRaider kiosk. Seems like it would be possible with the PCs we control and with the Dell images we manage. Maybe it could be dual-boot where the customer in Beatriceâ€™s situation could reboot and choose eRaider kiosk to get access to those tools, and then reboot to regular mode. Would take some work to set up, but the returns could be great.

Here is a summary of the events that took place for issues 543772, 543845, & 543854. I have placed it chronological order opposed to summarizing each 3 issues separately. I believe it better portrays the order of events and customer experience.  
  
Issue 543772  6/5 at 8:32 AM: Beatrice/customer cannot reset her password. She does not have access to the contact number listed. Wesley/SD SA gathered the correct information and asked Beatrice to send her ID to verify.ithelpcentral@ttu.edu. 6/5 at 8:59 AM: Ian/SD Staff noted that we received the ID and the account was reset.6/5 at 10:02 AM: Beatrice called back and spoke to Jeremy W/SD SA. Beatrice explains that she has not received the code and is now locked out of her computer completely (because the account was reset and she rebooted her computer). Jeremy suggests she use a phone or a different computer to see if she can check her SPAM or Junk email. He also explains that this code should be used in â€œSetup Accountâ€ area, not in the â€œReset Passwordâ€ area. The customer starts going through the setup process and they end the call since Beatrice is on the right track to setting up the account. Issue is closed. 
Issue 543845  6/5 at 10:57 AM: Wesley/SD SA starts a new issue for Beatrice calling in regards to setting up her account. Beatrice is trying to setup her account, but she is stuck on the â€œVoice Servicesâ€ step of the process. It gives her an error stating they must be â€œvalid 10 digit phoneâ€. Wesley then asks her to try this in Google Chrome. He starts by having her clear cache/cookies in Chrome. Beatrice tries to setup the account in Google Chrome, but then encounters an error stating that the email verification code is incorrect. Wesley then resent a setup code. Beatrice waited a few minutes to receive the code in her email, and eventually said she would be ok with ending the call to wait for the code. She was confident she would receive it since she has received the codes previously sent to this account. Issue was left as WoC. 
Issue 543854  6/5 at 11:11 AM: Beatrice emailed IT Help Central (creating a third issue) stating she could not get past the Voice services screen. It continues to tell her the numbers must be valid 10-digit phone numbers. Screenshot is attached.6/5 at 11:36 AM: Customer called in about the issue. When the customer explained how she was going through the account setup process, Jarret told her that her account was already activated. Based on locked account tool her password was just expired (if he had looked at her history he would have known that they had reset the account). After further research, he found one of the other issues and was caught up to speed. He had not seen this error before, and was unsure what to do since she had tried different browsers. He conferred with a staff member who suggested they send it up.6/5 at 11:43: Jarret reassigned the issue to SD staff.6/5 at 1:48 PM: Beatrice called back and spoke to Kassandra/SD SA and stated that she has been on the phone with IT Help Central all day and wants someone to come out to assist her with her problem. She has been unable to access her computer for 4 hours. Kassandra gathered the necessary information for Desktop and sent the issue up.6/5 at 3:17 PM: Sam/SD Sup reassigned the issue to Desktop.6/5 at 3:36 PM: Keenan/Desktop Staff made a note that he was sending the issue back to SD staff for eRaider troubleshooting. He then reassigned the issue.6/6 at 8:50 AM: Matthew/Desktop Staff accepted the issue per Ricâ€™s request. He stated he will contact the customer to come out. 
Issue  543845  6/6 at 9:59 AM: Beatrice called and spoke to Sara/SD Sup. Sarah also looked up the account in the locked account tool and told Beatrice that it shows she needs to reset her eRaider password. After Beatrice explained the background of her issue, Sara asked if she had a co-workerâ€™s computer she could borrow. Beatrice stated that no one was there and would not be there for an hour. Beatrice stated she was waiting for Desktop to come out, but they havenâ€™t yet. Sara told her that she did not have an issue assigned to Desktop (because she was looking at two of the issues, but not the third). Sara then continued to recommend she do all the things she had already tried (because she was not looking at all of the relevant issues). At this point, someone from another department arrived and was able to login to her computer so she could walk through the setup process. Sara had her go through the same process, but not put any phone numbers in the fields she was entering them in previously. Beatrice was able to setup her account. 
543772  6/6 at 9:47 AM: The customer emailed IT Help Central for issue 543772 (the first issue that was closed) stating Sarah walked her through the process and she was able to access her account now. 
543854  6/6 at 1:32 PM: Matthew arrived on site, but the issue was already resolved.6/6 at 2:08 PM: All three issues were closed. 
  
Customer feedback: 
First of all, Beatrice was inconvenienced by not being able to do her work for an entire 8 hours. This put her behind and the next day was rough catching up. She believes we should have a system where when someone is trying to get back into her computer, she should not have to utilize other individuals to assist in the process. Since she could not get into her computer to access the code sent to her email, she tried to use a laptop. However, she couldn't use that because she could not get on wifi, so she had to inconvenience her co-worker to reset her code. And while doing this she continued to run into problems. She also suggests that the person that she deals with initially should be the person to assist her throughout the life of the issue. She felt like she was passed around. 
  
Opportunities for Improvement  Beatrice might have felt passed around because each time she called she had to re-explain herself. If we had continued the same issue throughout the life of this problem, we might have avoided her feeling this way. Each agent would have been able to bring up the appropriate issue and be fully prepared on what had happened before and where they need to go with the issue from that point. Wesley has been coached to reopen the issue if the customer calls back for the same overall problem. We will coach Jarrett on better ways to find and identify duplicate issues in the customerâ€™s issue history. Also, to remember that when working requests, the request could possibly be related to an existing issue. I will also talk to Sara to figure out why she had issues locating the existing issues. Her screen capture was not in CIC for me to better understand her searching struggles. I have reported this to Brian.We coached Jeremy on being more inclined to stay on the phone with the customer and assist them all the way to resolution if possible.At the point where the customer informed us that she could not access her work computer at all, we should have set the Impact â€“ Operations to critical. She could not do ANY work. Inquiries in regards to urgency should have been made as well. Wesley Jarret, and Kassandra will be coached on this.Based on the issue notes and screenshot, I believe the issue with entering phone numbers in the â€œVoice Servicesâ€ screen should still be explored and documented.  In the event that a customer needs assistants with something that is eRaider related and she cannot login, should we be more inclined to send out Desktop opposed to asking her to have a co-worker login for her? I am not sure the answer to this, but I do know that the customer did not like inconveniencing others to solve her own issue. At one point, she had to ask someone outside of her department to login for her because no one from her department was in the office. Based on what I could hear in the call recordings, it appeared that the person was very hesitant to login for her because Beatrice could possibly access that individuals information/emails.

The customer submitted positive feedback but selected neutral for all survey categories. This seems to be a positive survey, but leaving open to be reviewed. 

Customer most likely put neutral because her issue wasn't resolved the first time she called, but she gave a raving response about the second person to help her and her issue only took 24 hours to solve. Pushing survey through.

My experience  with Karisa was wonderful. she resolved  my issues. However,  I should 
note  that leading  up to  my contact with Karisa was very disappointing. For  four to 
five days I dealt at length with students Jeremy  and Matthew and was  given incorrect 
and  confusing information.

Again,  Karisa worked wonders  but the events leading up to my contact  with her  was 
frustrating, confusing and offered incorrect information.

On your explanation for the first point, thatâ€™s not exactly what I had in mind. However, you bring up some great points and I think youâ€™re correct on all of it. What I primarily had in mind was the technical aspect of it. Hereâ€™s how I understand that it works: Your current eRaider password and the one right before it will not cause lockouts. However, the one before the previous password will cause lockouts. 
  
Example: 
  
Letâ€™s say I have this:   A Windows desktop I use daily An iPhone I use daily An old iPad that mostly sits on the floor in my office 
    My password is set to â€œPa$$w0rd1â€ and is stored in my iPhone Wi-Fi settings, iPad Wi-Fi settings, and in Credential Manager in Windows. I change my password to â€œPa$$w0rd2â€. I update Credential Manager in Windows and Wi-Fi on my iPhone, but not my iPad Wi-Fi. No lockouts experienced. The password stored in Wi-Fi on the iPad is â€œPa$$w0rd1â€ which is one password back and wonâ€™t count against lockout policy. Three months later, I change my password to â€œPa$$w0rd3â€. I update Credential Manager in Windows, but I forget about Wi-Fi on my iPhone and Wi-Fi on my iPad. I begin experiencing lockouts due to â€œPa$$w0rd1â€ being saved on my iPad. I contact IT Help Central. IT Help Central â€œhelpsâ€ me by urging me to change my password. I set it to â€œPa$$w0rd4â€. I continue to experience lockouts since we didnâ€™t look at the root cause to start with. We finally begin troubleshooting the lockout problem. The troubleshooting is now more difficult because I have multiple devices causing lockout instead of just the one (iPad). 
Youâ€™re correct in that we ultimately have to get to the root of the problem. However, changing the password not only delays the real troubleshooting that has to take place, it actually makes it much more difficult and increases the number/frequency of lockouts. 
  
On the second point, Iâ€™m not sure I understand that well enough to try to explain it. Letâ€™s just move on.

Changing eRaider password to try to fix lockouts can only exasperate the problem. Need to coach Evan on that. I can explain why if you're not aware. Call me if so. I believe I understand this. If the customer is already having problems with devices/software automatically using old credentials, changing the password in eRaider doesnâ€™t target the root of the problem. At the time of the call, Evan didnâ€™t try to figure out if the lock outs were from the customer not knowing the password, or some other device/software using old credentials. And, changing the password again could possibly cause more problems because you could have some devices/software automatically using the previous password, which can continue the lock out.
 
 I think the fix was likely to remove old Exchange 2010 entries from Credential Manager. The customer's approach probably accomplished this same end, but was more than needed to be done. I guess I still donâ€™t fully understand this. I could understand how this would cause Outlook not to connect, but how would this have locked him out before Evan had him change the password? Maybe since his email couldnâ€™t connect, he just started trying various passwords to see if he could get in?
 
 We should have a standard solution about how to troubleshoot account lockouts (search tguide lockout). I'm curious why he didn't follow it. It would've guided him to check Credential Manager. I didnâ€™t realize there was a solution for this. We will coach him on using this solution, but also to be asking the right questions to get to the root of the problem and donâ€™t assume the customer is typing the password in wrong.

I called and emailed this individual. No response to date. When I called the numbers associated with this customer through authoritative data, I was unable to reach him. Since his timeliness rating is dissatisfied, here is a timeline of the issue. 
    6/5 at 8:23 PM: Mr. Pearce called IT Help Central and spoke to Evan/SD Supervisor. Mr. Pearce reported that he could not sign in to his email via outlook. Mr. Pearce stated that he had been migrated and had already restarted Outlook. He is receiving the error â€œIncorrect username/password.â€ Locked account tool showed that he was locked due to incorrect passwords. Evan walked the customer through resetting his password. He was still locked out, and Evan continued to see that something was attempting to login and lock out the customer. Evan explained that there may be another device that is trying to login automatically with the incorrect password. Evan suggested the customer wait 15 minutes and then try again. If Mr. Pearce was still unable to sign in, Evan suggested he call IT Help Central in the morning (because the call was near closing hours). 6/8 at 11:48 AM: Kailey K/SD Tech emailed the customer to see if the customer was able to regain access to their TechMail account. 6/8 at 11:52 AM: Mr. Pearce stated that he had to remove the account from Outlook and add it back to resolve the issue. 
After listening to the call, I think Evan handled it OK. I did find it odd that one of his first troubleshooting suggestions was to reset the password without asking a few more questions or doing a bit more research. We can coach him on this. Also, based on the symptoms (eRaider account being locked out), I donâ€™t the Evan would have thought to remove and re-add the account in Outlook to resolve this issue. Not sure we need to coach on this or create a solution on this if the migrations are done. Please let me know if any of you think otherwise. 
  
In regard to follow-up time, the issue was placed in a â€œWaiting on Customerâ€ status after Evan talked to him on 6/5. We did not follow-up until 6/8, but this was also the week that we had a heavy call/request volume due to school starting and the migration.

I have discovered that not all problems were solved.  I can get my mail, and send, but none of 
my calendar information can be retrieved.

I have hit the sync button, and the status window says it is working through everything at 
length, but there's no indication that it's dealing with anything but the mail.  

We;ll see.

I will also note that my perception of what the tech was saying was very faulty because I was 
unable to make out the words through his accent, so I had him repeat many instructions several 
times.

  Good Afternoon Ms. Perry,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.  I have reviewed your issue and made notes of areas where we can improve our service. I have also passed along the feedback in regards to the software availability for retired individuals to my management.
   
  I would like to speak with you and discover if there are any other areas where we can improve our services. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-8192 or reply to this email.
   
  Thank you again, and please let us know if we can provide further assistance in the future. Sincerely,

I have attempted to call and email this customer. No response to date.  
  
This customer was having issues with accessing TechMail in Outlook 2003 after the migration. Our agents asked the customer to upgrade to Outlook 2016. However, this customer is retired and cannot download Office 2016. She ended up purchasing Office 2013 and was able to get it to connect. Based on feedback she provided in the issue notes (which was placed in the complaint/suggestion field in FootPrints), the customer is most dissatisfied by the fact that retirees cannot download this software from TTU for free. 
  
Opportunities for Improvement:  Joshua/SD Tech and Taha/SD SA both attempted to assist the customer in downloading Office 2016. We will coach these individuals on the importance of looking at customer type, and that retired account types donâ€™t have access to this software (referencing the eRaider profile spreadsheet).I noticed that we do not have anything in the k-base in regard to Office 365 not supporting the connection of Exchange (MAPI) in Outlook 2003. I am creating a solution on this.I thought it odd that two individuals didnâ€™t catch that this customer was a retiree. I have asked Peyton/Training Sup to make sure we are addressing the importance of looking at account type before referencing any services that would be dependent on account type. We train on the different account types and how their access varies. Peyton thought it would be handy to add this scenario (or a similar one) to our practice calls so the students learn a real world application of the information we already train on.

Ismael is a great asset to the TTU team. He is extremely responsive, knowledgeable, and very 
professional. He comes in and gets the job done and if there is anything else that arises, he is 
here in no time. He also follows up to make sure everything is running the way it should. Kudos 
to Ismael. Thanks, Josh

I called and followed up with this customer the day of the survey. She gave me a bit more information about this, and we re-opened the issue. I also called the person that had been sending these to see if he had in fact sent out some meeting cancellations. Shortly after I spoke with the second individual, Scott hall called me about this because Lucy had notified Mr. Segran and Mr. Segran had asked Scott do handle. 

Created Flag for Kira to be coached.

Hello Chris and Scott, 
  
When I called Ms. Lanotte to follow up on this issue, she informed me that she has already emailed Mr. Segran about what she is experiencing. Just wanted to make sure you were aware of this issue. 
  
Ms. Lanotte called and spoke with Kira/SD SA about receiving cancellation notifications for a presidentâ€™s advisory meeting with participants that have not worked here in quite some time. The meeting is scheduled for today and has been cancelled. She didnâ€™t open the email because it seemed fishy (or possibly phishy) to her. They appear to be from Jim Douglass. She is wondering if his account has been hacked.  
  
Kira consulted with Paul about this issue. I donâ€™t know how Kira asked the question, or how Paul presented his recommendation, but Kira told the customer that her staff member stated that it is because the person who created the event forgot to turn off the notifications. The customer stated that these were from 5 years ago. Kira continued to explain as if Paulâ€™s recommendation of what could be causing the issue was definitely causing it. The customer did not seem satisfied with this answer. I am guessing she was disappointed that we didnâ€™t offer to research further. 
  
I called the customer to apologize. I am also re-opening the issue. I have asked Ms. Lanotte to send me an attachment of the cancellation emails (this is what she sent Mr. Segran). The first thing I will check is to see if Mr. Douglass did in fact cancel some meetings today. Depending on what I find out from Kira/Paul, I believe we should coach Kira on understanding the thought process when it comes to taking symptoms from a customer and come up with possible conclusions. When more symptoms come to light, it can change what we once thought was the root cause of the issue.  
  
Thanks,

As far as this issue is concerned, I did receive answers and solutions with this one phone call. The 
technician, Bo, was very helpful, courteous and knowledgeable. However, I was shocked to learn 
that as a TTU retiree, I would no longer have access to the Microsoft suite of programs (Excel, Word, 
Powerpoint, etc.). Today, when I opened up a spreadsheet I had been using for years, I learned that 
my "subscription has expired." I will obviously have to purchase my own software instead of 
downloading it through the TTU license. I understand if retirees will no longer receive this benefit, 
but I received NO warning that this was going into effect. The least TTU could have done was to 
alert me, and others in this situation, prior to now. Instead, I learned of this by suddenly having 
limited access to documents I have been using for years. Very disappointing. If benefits we are 
accustomed to receiving are going to change or be withdrawn, the university should give us 
sufficient notice so we can make other arrangements.

I entered satisfied for the overall service experience because after picking the laptop up, there are new

I want to commend Ian Hooten for helping me resolve this issue in a timely ma
manner.  He quickly understood what was needed and walked me through the ne
necessary steps.

Unfortunately the front-line staff who answered my initial email inquiries were less 
than helpful.  Their emailed responses did not address the question being posed and 
instead directed me to askit.ttu.edu for an unrelated issue.  I asked a related 
question about receiving email alerts on a non-primary mailbox, stating clearly that 
I'd already tried a mailbox rule, without success.  I received an email with an 
explanation on how to set up a mailbox rule.  Ultimately the resolution was to make 
the non-primary account primary and thanks for Mr. Hooten's assistance, everything 
is working as desired.

The service on the call was great, but I am upset that I missed my ttu emails for a number of 
days (this includes emails from colleagues saying "sorry, I didn't see your email, apparently TTU 
messed with some settings and I didn't get my email for days!) so I wasn't the only one. 
-- I should have realized something was up, but the notice you emailed to me on the 8th 
mentioned only checking email online which I basically never do. Still, my fault for not realizing 
I wasn't receiving anything.

The person who helped me was very nice. I think Tech should send out an email when they are 
doing maintenance or update something on their website that may cause it to act strange so it 
causes less confusion and frustration with students, faculty and staff.

so that I could continue to receive email while I am away from both my home and

trauma I experience when I try to re-set technology.  I may have to call IT help

assistance that does not make me feel more stupid about technology than I already

It was unreal how quickly my issue was resolved.  I no sooner hung up the phone and he was in 
the classroom, working on the solution.  

I was shocked.  My students were shocked.  None of us expected to have the issue resolved so 
quickly.  The technician was amazing.  Thanks so much for saving the day.

Once I started talking to the analyst things went smoothly. However, when I called I was told that I was 
3rd in line, then 2nd, and then no one was ahead of me. Yet after no one was ahead of me I waited some 
10 minutes (as best as I can remember) to speak to an analyst. It seems it should not have taken so long 
once I was first in line.

He was very patient with me and made sure ALL of my questions were answered fully and

drive was excellent. His aim was to please me in a most pleasant way by making sure I 
understood the answers to ALL of my questions. There was much I did not understand about this 
new format and he had to repeat information because of my misunderstanding.  I am 80 years

Listened to the call. Alex handled it well. I did notice that the customer may not have recognized the home page since we recently changed the link in Raiderlink to go to office.com instead of mail.ttu.edu. 

Called Anna at 8065704321. She did not answer. I left a voice mail. 

 
  Dear Ms. Word,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.

It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer every time they use our services.  Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery.
   
  I would like to speak with you and discover how we can improve our service. If you care to follow up, you can contact me directly at 806-834-8192.

Created flag to discuss a few items with Alex. He did a great job overall, I just wanted to let him know that the link in Raiderlink changes.

There were assumptions made on Alexâ€™s part that did not help this issue. Based on the screen capture from the call, Alex did try and go through the process the customer was explaining, but he skipped a part due to an assumption. Since he assumed this link went to, and has always gone to office.com, that is the URL he went to when walking through this with her. Since the customer made it seem like this new interface was drastically different, he just assumed she was recently migrated and that is why she had never seen this before.  
  
Thanks,

I expect our employees to have enough discernment, sense, and training to go through what the customer is doing along with them (when we have access to the same service like with Raiderlink). I also expect them to know how (either on their own or with training) to hover the mouse cursor over a link to view where it leads before they click it. 
  
I donâ€™t remember anyone communicating with me that the email link in Raiderlink was changed, but I would have hopefully had the presence of mind to check and see where it leads. 
  
All my comments are without having listened to this call. I feel like I donâ€™t have all the details.

Hello, 
  
I have attempted to contact this customer via phone and email. No response to date.  
  
This issue was resolved during the initial call, so I am not sure why the customer rated â€œTimeliness of the service providedâ€ as â€œDissatisfied.â€ The call was 13 minutes long, but this time seemed necessary based on the amount of time it took the customer to explain the issue as well as the amount of time it took Alex Magier/SD Supervisor to explain what was going on. The customer thought her account had been compromised because the link to TechMail within Raiderlink was taking her to a new place that she was not familiar with. Alex explained it was legitimate. 
  
Granted, I donâ€™t think Alex realized that the link in Raiderlink was now going to Outlook.com opposed to the direct sign-in to OWA. I will go over this with him. Was this ever communicated to Service Desk? Should I have made this communication to SD? Regardless, Alex did take the time to go over what these new applications were and explain to the customer how to get to mail from the main O365 page. 
  
Thanks,

I am rating primarily my experience with the last analysts, who was the fifth one I
spoke with today.  All were unfailingly polite and at least somewhat helpful, but it
was the last one who actually narrowed down the problem and found the specific
solution. Given that it required a process of elimination to which all the other
analysts contributed, overall rating would still be "satisfied" despite the time
consumed due to the difficulty of the problem.

Ashley Prothro was my analyst this second time around today.  She provided me with a high 
caliber of support that required troubleshooting to figure out the problem I was having with 
SPSS since Thursday morning.  It was time consuming to discover the glitch, yet she was 
extraordinarily patient to get to the root of the issue.  

Thank you Ashley for demonstrating that you cared about my dilemma.  Also, thank you for 
demonstrating professionalism and expertise with dissecting the SPSS issue to make things 
right!  I can now foresee a more positive and peaceful weekend in store for me.

Thank you again and have a great weekend!

Resolution of the issue took between 5 to 7 days, I can't remember exactly.  A little slow IMO, 
but then again every issue is different and maybe this one was more confounding than most.  
Just glad it's finally fixed.  The people I spoke with regarding the issue were very friendly.

One thing that's a little annoying is that every time you call in or email regarding the issue, a 
new issue is automatically created.  That creates unnecessary hassle, especially for the analysts 
working on the issue.

Notes from listening to the call:
    Do not verify by R number.  The customer did explain that he is having this issue using Outlook (client) as well as in OWA (server). This would have been important to document because it would have eluded that this issue is probably not with the client he is using (Outlook). If he was getting the emails in OWA, but not in Outlook, then that would have pointed to a client issue.   Why did you not start an issue immediately and start taking notes in the issue so this could have been documented?  Please show Taha there is a way access recover deleted items in Outlook as well as OWA.  Taha walked the customer through checking deleted items and recover deleted items to see if any rules were sending them there. Taha did not document this. We have coached Taha before on documenting every symptom the customer presents as well as every troubleshooting item that is performed.  Did not ask for the urgency. Mr. Torres expressed to me that this was critical. I am glad that Taha set impact/operations to critical, but should have asked him how urgent this seemed. Mr. Torres was expecting the call back the next day, so that might have been why he didn't feel the need to stress the urgency since he thought it was being handled as if it was an urgent matter.  Should have documented in the issue that the customer was expecting a call back the next day, and document who stated they would call the customer the next day.     Called Mr. Torres, here is his feedback.
  Issue was critical. He said he would pass it along to his supervisor to follow up the next day. Based on the phone conversation, it appears as if someone told taha to send it up because they would follow up the next day.
   
  However, Randall sent the issue back to techs and sups. Because of their queue numbers, this was not addressed until 6/24. 

Coaching records have been created for Taha and John. Marking as reviewed.

Good Afternoon Mr. Lopez,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the IT Division. I have reviewed your issue and was not confident if you meant to score as very dissatisfied, just from looking at the issue notes. Sometimes customers choose the wrong end of the scale on the survey. If you did intend for very dissatisfied scores, I would like to speak with you to get more details that may not be present in our issue documentation notes. It is our ultimate goal to provide excellent, timely service for every customer, every time they use our service. Customer satisfaction feedback definitely assists in our continuous improvement of our processes and service delivery. Thank you again and please contact me either by email or phone at your earliest convenience.

Hello,

After reviewing the issue, it appears the timeliness could've been due to contacting an outside source or walk-up, and the quality of service is due to us not being able to help on initial contact and having to send customer to walk-up.

Leaving open per mixed customer feedback. 

The customer consistently kept sending emails inquiring about his issue, which ironically put his issue further down the open queue. It was also unfortunate timing that the phishing crisis started around this time.

After reviewing this call, it appears the agent gathered good information and researched the issue in the KBase but didn't find much to assist her. He is also a new hire so he wouldn't have all the common knowledge to assist the customer and the call took under 20 minutes. He tried to assist her before recommending her Primary Support Provider with is the correct protocol.

It took three technicians/callbacks for me to resolve the problem. I had difficulty 
understanding the last one because of his dialect but he was very patient with me and 
finally resolved the problem. All three were very courteous and understanding. It just 
seems like the process (recovering my eraider account) was much more difficult than it 
should have been.

I frequently send scam/phishing emails to IT HELP for review.  All staff members are
helpful and respond within a very reasonable time.  Usually the emails are obviously
scam messages so I delete them as soon as I forward a copy to IT HELP.  Occasionally
an IT HELP staff member says the message was not received with my initial request. 
That is confusing because I go back and look at the sent message and indeed I
attached the message.  After review I delete the sent message with the copy as well.  
In this case, the message was received and reviewed.  
Thank you,
Laura

Leaving open for review per customer feedback. 

Some students are unaware of the fact that emails as attachments are culled by footprints and a supervisor must get them from the deleted items folder in the functional mailbox. We are already training on this.

My issue started on August 3rd, 2017; I called around 705 am; the young lady I 
spoke to was stumped and didn't know how to resolve my issue.  I called back after 
8am; spoke to someone else...she was very friendly and tried to walk me through 
issue as it was very difficult; she did ask me to bring in laptop.  Since I was leaving 
on vacation that day I was unable to take laptop in until today 8/7/17.  The tech 
that helped me was a young man and he was very helpful and explained the 
problem to me in a manner I could understand.  He explained that laptop was not 
on domain; so he fixed the problem promptly.  Later today I called and spoke to a 
young lady about another problem...I was left on hold off and on for 25 min. and 
during that time I received a call and hung up on her.  I called back to let Tech 
know that problem was resolved.  I do appreciate you all so much.  I am so limited 
in time I use on phone.

I have looked over this issue and can find no reason for dissatisfaction. The customer did not contact me back. Based on this survey/issue however, we have updated the knowledge base on how to make international calls (it includes what SAs should should if they need to place an international call [contact a tech+] or how techs+ can make this call via CIC). This is because no one tried to call this customer, they only corresponded via email.

Hello, 
  
I attempted to contact this customer. No response to date. I cannot find a reason for dissatisfaction by looking at the issue notes. However, this survey did prompt conversation about the studentâ€™s ability to call internationally and a solution has been created/published to address. Further details can be found in the survey or the issue.

I've learned my lesson: do not let your password expire!  Reestablishing it is a 
colossal pain in the keester.  Your publicity announced hours of operation beginning 
at 7:00,  Not altogether true.  Yes, I reached a human being at 7:00am when I 
phoned only to be told to call back at 8:00 "when the staff will be here."  Not much 
help.  Not a very informed person when I called after 8:00 and asked where I* 
could physically take my problem.  The young woman said I needed to go to fourth 
street.  I learned later there was a facility in the SUB.  When I finally got to the SUB 
facility, I received excellent service (yea Ali et al.!!) literally four 
technicians/managers and after some gyrations, my problem was solved.

After reviewing the issue, it appears we should've automatically directed the customer to IT solutions, QFs were already made for this, which is most likely the reason for a neutral rating on technical skills and quality. It took 11 days for this issue to get assigned to staff, which then took 4 to relay information to contact IT Solutions to customer. This is due to being behind on issues this summer.

Looking over the issue, it appears that we did handle this issue properly. I was unable to discuss this issue with the customer, but it does appear that he was mainly dissatisfied that he had to replace his computer to resolve the issue. I am not sure if that was the true fix. He replaced it in the middle of us troubleshooting the issue. He informed Karisa in the middle of the issue that he was replacing it.

Ashley, 

  
The reasoning behind my dissatisfied survey was due to the following account: 

  
Two days before the Bar Exam held at Texas Tech University, I received several "Peer 2 Peer" pop-up messages that morning around 8:30am. Due to these pop-ups, I was not able to access any of my Texas Tech accounts such as my email or raider link. Thus, I called main campus IT later that morning and notified them of the problem and set an appointment to go in that morning.  

  
Once I arrived to the IT service, I explained to the student all the steps I took in order to resolve the problem on my own. I asked him what exactly the message meant and how I needed to resolve the issue, or how he would resolve it. Though very courteous, he did not know what exactly what "peer 2 peer" meant and did not know how to resolve the issue. Rather, he took the same exact steps as I had told him I had taken that morning to solve the issue on my own. For thirty minutes, he went back and forth to talk to his "supervisor" to get advice on how to solve the issue.  

  
When a student is struggling to resolve an issue himself, and it is very evident he lacks the requisite knowledge, I would expect the "supervisor" to come out right away. Yet, it was not until the fourth time the student went in to talk to his supervisor, that he decided to come out.  

  
I was greeted by yet another student, who was the "supervisor." The supervisor did not know how to even navigate a MacBook and had to ask the student to help assist. The supervisor looked at my laptop for less than 5 minutes and told me he did not know how to resolve the issue. I asked him if there was anyone else I could talk to that might resolve the issue. He called his "on-call manager" who told him that he did not know the issue as well and Texas Tech Security would have to resolve it.  

  
Although both students were very courteous, they clearly were not experienced. Unlike the law school, students should not be working at the IT department if they do not have the requisite knowledge nor experience to work on issues like this. Students, even supervisor, should at least know how to navigate both a PC and a Mac.  

  
My frustration stemmed not from their ability to resolve the issue itself (although this is the second time i have come to IT and they could not resolve my computer issue), as I understand that sometimes we just do not have all the answers. My frustration came from the fact that there were no professional Tech Staff on site to assist, only one student after another.  

  
Although I do appreciate how respectful and courteous these students were during this service, I highly recommend Texas Tech have at least one professional IT staff on site during hours of operation. I noticed that there is an "on-call" system for staff in place, but on-call means that the staff come and resolve the issue directly when a problem arises.  

  
I have already graduated and will no longer need the main campus IT services. However, I hope this email will better supplement the survey review I have given earlier.  

  
Respectfully,

Dear Ms. Yi,
   
  First of all, thank you so much for this valuable information. This will definitely help us to revisit the way in which this was handled. Each one of these items will be address to see where we can improve.
   
  I am so sorry that this happened during such a crucial time. Critical issues should be handled with a certain level of priority. This will be discussed as well.
   
  I understand that you have graduated (congratulations), but if for whatever reason you do have any other questions or concerns, you can always reach out to me directly at 806-834-8192 or ashley.prothro@ttu.edu.
   
  Thanks,

I believe the person I deal with was named Christopher and he was very helpful and
very courteous.  

My complaint is why isn't the detailed instructions that he helped me locate in AskIT
for how to post a TechAnnounce located on the same page as where you actually post a
TechAnnounce?  There is a FAQ page on the left hand menu side but it wasn't as
detailed.

Cedisha Pitts was very helpful in helping me when my account was hacked.  
Unfortunately hers was the only name that I remembered but all of the staff and 
student staff that worked with me were very helpful and worked quickly and 
diligently to get me through this dilemma; giving me useful advice and answering 
my questions.

Thank you I wish I could go back and provide you with other names

GOD bless you all,

Once we talked through the issue at length, it was solved.  He was really trying to help, which I 
appreciated!!  LONG wait to talk to someone though.
Original Issue = 561093
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = ITHC Service Desk Student Supervisor, ITHC Service Desk Student Technician 

leaving open because of the neutral rating and the mixed comment. 

The wait time being long is because we had a high call flow and not enough people to take those calls since it was the beginning of the semester. After reviewing the call, the agent had a long hold time and the agent didn't immediately search the KBase which lengthened the call time and also lowered his potential technical skills.

My problem was not resolved, but this is not the fault of the analyst.

I encourage IT to change the music/advertising during the telephone wait/hold period. It is 
impossible to listen to. Perhaps the sound of moving water, please. Something suitable to a

JW was very professional and helpful. I will return again to the IT Service Desk if I 
have any other issue. Another woman I spoke with on a different occasion was also 
very helpful and personable. So far my encounters at the IT Help Desk have been very

I want to commend Bo and Cedisha for the time and attention that they gave to 
solving my problems with my laptop and my phone. I always feel a sense of despair 
when my computer and my cell phone do not connect with my TTU Outlook email 
and  calendar, and my computer does not connect with the TechShare Drive. I went 
to ITHelp office, where Cedisha and Bo were on duty. Cedisha was very gracious 
and helpful even though working to help me made her stay beyond the hours she 
was to be at the office, and Bo assisted as needed to reinforce the actions taken.

They represent the best of TTU, and I am grateful for them an your office. Everyone 
has always been so helpful to me. I cannot thank you enough.
Best wishes,
Bess

When reviewing the issue, I tried to pull up the call from the first time the customer called but I could not find it. The only call I found was when the call was transferred to Colby, 100156620420170914. The customer most likely had been waiting for his call to be taken for 8 minutes. I will be pulling the call information from earlier in the day and viewing the statuses of those working during this time. 

I am marking as reviewed since we cannot put the call logs for unanswered calls after a week. However, we have already brought to SD attention the wait time issue and to encourage those not to stay in a "wrapping" up status unless absolutely necessary.

It was made easy for me to reset my password when I didn't have access to the phone number that was 
registered in my account. It took some proof of my identity through documentation, which took a bit of time, 
but I wouldn't want it any other way, it makes me feel safe that my account is being protected.

Don't tell the customer you are putting them on hold. Ask the customer if you can place the call on hold.
   
  Maria uses short and sweet sentences, but she provides more detail then most. I appreciate the details that she includes in the issue notes.
   
  Good job apologizing for the wait. Also, you can thank them for holding.
   
  Even offered to email her the solution! Good Job!
   
  I am pretty impressed with this call since Maria is fairly new. I think she handled it well. I will call Allison to figure out more details about the rating. 

I called the customer to get more details about her ratings. She stated that "now was not a good time for that." I let her know I would send her an email. 

 
  Dear Ms. Hughes,Thank you for taking time to provide us feedback on your recent service experience with IT Help Central and the TTU IT Division.

For the timeliness - my biggest issue is that it took 35 minutes to figure
out that my issue was that I should simply log into raiderlink at home
rather than at the university I am at.

application for something I've been working on for a couple of months.  Kudos to Clayton!

i can't really comment on much.  I sent in a suspected phishing attempt.  I figured you wanted to know 
them in all of their manifestations for blocking purposes.  I don't always hear back if it was a spam or not 
and the numbering system doesn't help much.  I think if i could log in by my raiderlink and then see all the 
my requests it might be helpful.  If that is an option now, then I am unaware of it and more ease and 
awareness could be helpful.

IT help is always diligent, friendly and helpful, but in this instance the first response 
could have disastrous, but thanks to an on site member of IT it was not. Later the  
help center contacted me to correct the situation, so again IT help saved the day; 
explanations and apologies were given so everything turned out fine.

Thanks again for being there.

I called Ms. Cruse and left a voicemail. 

Here are her comments from the issue notes:
  Customer was transferred to me by Taha as  she wanted to speak to a supervisor. Customer wanted to make sure that  her account would not be disabled again and that we call her in a timely  fashion when her account gets re-enabled as it took us until the next  day to reach out to her. Customer also wanted it to be on record that  she did not appreciate having to send a picture ID to have her password  changed. 
  Customer informed me the issue has been resolved and that I can close it.
  Closing issue.

The lady I talked to was awesome. But man, the password set up for this application is a big 
waste of time with too many stipulations. These stipulations actually make it easier for someone 
to get my password since I now need to store it elsewhere and not coded.

Karisa Payne was incredibly helpful throughout addressing my issue. When it seemed like I had 
fallen through the cracks and could not get an update on progress, she consistently stepped up 
to chase down updates and new solutions. There were times when she was obviously stuck 
between my frustration and slow progress through TTU channels, and she was consistently 
gracious. I really appreciate that she was responsive and honest throughout our interaction.

I would also like to thank Randall King for directing me to very helpful resources for ensuring I 
completely removed the problem software prior to attempting the new installation.

The second technician who I spoke to was amazing, she knew what she was talking about was extremely 
paciente and helped me fix the problem in no time. After the problem was fixed she still stayed on the Phone 
until I got adsolutely everything logged in in both of my devices. 
Amazing service

Kennan was prompt and professional.  He came to my office on a Friday and took the laptop 
with him to fix.  It was fixed 10 days later.  The only thing that would have improved the

would be ready.

The service remediating the problem was great, particularly for a saturday. The only problem I

what I needed to do and he made sure that I had no problems at the end. I am very 
grateful that he took the time to help me. I told him I needed to urgently email a 
faculty member and because of his help I was able to. Thanks Luis!

We did not have this customers phone number so we only corresponded via email. However, we were not getting closer to resolution via email. After a few emails, we should have asked the customer for a phone number.
   
  The issue about not calling customer will be addressed in training and in upcoming tech and sup meetings.

When I contacted IT Help about my locked account they were very quick to respond and explain 
how to get access again. The one thing I am unhappy about is the way the account was 
repeatedly blocked and at no time was I contacted. I left phone numbers for contact and IT 
insisted on using the VOIP phone lines. First I do not use the VOIP line ttu has assigned to me. 
Second a VOIP line wouldn't work if the computer is inactivated. Duh.

This issue arose out of the upgrade of the DNS service in late October, 2017. Two of
my hostnames stopped resolving correctly on TTUNet. Right after my help request, they
started resolving correctly again. 

Also, the analyst informed me that I need to use the RDP gateway rather VPN to access
my office computers from off-campus.

After reviewing the issue, I have found the customer had to uninstall and re-install Java which does take time. The issue doesn't state that we recommended her to her PSP but if since this is a TTU owned computer it is understandable that she needed to talk to them.

I apologize for it getting back in touch with you after I could access the site.  As far as the tech support goes, 
the tech assumed this was the same issue impacting all registrations without asking for the error message I

Survey was done around the time of of another issue regarding a compromised account. Ashley and I believe this survey is pertaining to the customer's experience with that particular issue. Linking the other issue to this survey.

the student assistant who was an analyst didn't really understand the issue (granted, it's a weird and 
complicated one), but the staff member, Ian Hooten fixed a problem we had been working on with 
departmental IT staff for over three hours, in FIVE MINUTES. That was amazing!! thank you very very 
much!

After reviewing the issue, it appears the SA did not create an issue. I have created a QF for this.

Service was fine-the employee had to find the answer but did so quickly. I am a bit upset to find out that the 
Microsoft office software no longer works as a retiree both in the hassle it is going to be to get it uninstalled & 
also the expense of purchasing.  We get a free parking pass on campus. One would think we could continue to 
use the software.

This was last Spring (2017) in MCOM 255.  After my call, the speakers were worked on
and worked for a class period or two. Then they stopped working.  I did not call
again.  In the whole scheme of life, classroom speakers that don't work well is a
small thing.  I never saw the technician.  The work was done outside of my class.

This semester (Fall 2017) I was able to secure another room where the speakers worked
fine (MCOM 168).

I reached out to the customer but had to leave a voicemail. I acknowledged and apologized that our response time and communication did not meet their expectations. I will be drafting an email to CTS management to bring light to this issue. 

The customer called me back and wanted to be clear that they were not mad or upset, they just wanted to convey that they would be avoiding the room that they had issues with, and clarify what the survey they were filling out was for.

I worked with Paul for about 8 minutes. My home computer would not receive or send
e-mails.  However, I could receive and send e-mails from my I-phone.  Paul was very
friendly, professional and prompt in dealing with my problem.  I am a retired dean;
therefore, I did not have immediate access to IT assistance.  I could not ask for a
more positive experience.

Thanks.

I can't begin to express my thanks to everyone who worked on assisting me to set up
the Business Partner Account for Mr. Greg Gamel.  Everyone was so kind and helpful
and definitely went above and beyond in providing exemplary customer service to get
this account set up within 24 hours of the request being submitted.  This was a
critical request as Mr. Gamel has to complete a lot of work on our website within a
very short time frame.  If the IT team had not done such an excellent job, Mr. Gamel
would not have had time to complete the project.  I wish that I could personally
acknowledge everyone who assisted with this request but I don't have everyone's
names.  Please know that the customer service provided on this request was better
than anything that I could ever hope for.  WELL DONE IT TEAM!  Thank you so very much.

The young-sounding, kind, patient East Indian woman resolved my weeks-long 
problem (not being able to e-send messages) -- she suggested uninstalling a 
recent "install" I'd done.  I have my doubts.  She patiently talked me through the 
process & then stayed on the phone with me until the process was complete.  It 
took a while to realize that her solution had resolved the issue, so I'm pleased to 
have this official opportunity to thank her.

Your entire team is amazing!  I'm one of your most frequent (& whine-y) patrons.  
You always resolve my issues (that -- at the time:  I am sure will end civilization as 
we now know it.

able to accomplish my requests. And then when I was still not able to access an
additional mailbox, the technician followed up on the issue and resolved it for me.

I wish the passwords didn't expire as much; I feel they don't need to be changed as often, it is just a hassle. 
I also wish that you could send the new password code via an alternate email to me instead of 
texting/voicecalling. I travelled internationally this winter and had a very hard time changing my password, since 
my given phone number didn't work. I wish there was a way to not change my password or to use my email to 
change it.

I tried calling this customer back but there was no answer. I left a voicemail for them and requested they call me back to discuss the ratings they provided in this survey. 
  After reviewing the issue, the customer states that they had emailed a question to blackboard@ttu.edu and got a response 6 days later. I provided the customer with the phone number for Blackboard Faculty support that they can use in the future instead of email if they have a pressing time-sensitive question. There were no comments in the survey, and I was unable to obtain any additional information.

I felt like a complete failure not being able to figure out how to see my classes on blackboard. I am a returning 
student after 15+ years and I spent over two hours this morning in black tutorials on YouTube and the internet. 
My online class instructor indicated that classes started on Tuesday 1/16/2018 and I cannot for the life of me 
figure out how to see the class or the content . She emailed us all the syllabus and i am so worries about 
starting off behind. I am 45 and completing my first bachelors after 7 years of chemo related to leukemia and a 
bone marrow transplant and I do not learn and retain the same as i used to.

A VERY long story short, the young lady that assisted me today completely helped my already very insecure 
confidence get a boost up by letting me know that there is no way I could see my class on blackboard till the 
first day of â€œofficialâ€ classes. She also made me feel Good about myself since I tried so hard to help myself 
before throwing in the towel and calling for assistance. In addition to that, she assured me that I can feel free 
to call for assistance in the future if I needed it. Thank you!!!

In MATH 012, the switch to project from the doc cam or the PC is in the worst place 
imaginable. I have to get on my knees and hold a flashlight in one hand and find the 
switch in the back of the lowest shelf of the cabinet with the other hand. Can you 
move it to a more convenient place, so we can use both the PC and the doc cam in 
the same lecture? I am an old man.

After reviewing the two phone calls that occurred during the life of this issue, I found that two agents suggested trying a different browser to resolve a Former Tech Admissions account issue. While this is sound troubleshooting advice, the agents should have referred the customer to TTU Admissions for further assistance, as this is not an eRaider authenticated service. 
   
  Both agents that worked this issue and spoke to the customer will be coached on how to support non-eRaider authenticated services. 
   
  I called the customer and left a voicemail apologizing for not providing the correct information immediately, and suggested they reach out to Admissions if they were still experiencing the account issue. I asked that they call me back if they need any further assistance with this issue or if they would like to provide and additional feedback.

I'm very happy with IT Help Central.  However, the issue was forwarded to Desktop Support.  I 
spoke to someone in Desktop Support yesterday.  I expected to have someone come to my class 
today in Science 203 at 10 to work on the issue.  No one came.  I waited until the end of my 
class at 10:30 to comment.  I hope there isn't any confusion with the coordination.  I need my 
students to be able to work with PDF files so they can work on their Labs and submit 
assignments.  Thank you.

This issue was resolved. The cause was someone being out sick, and the other person that went did not have admin credentials to the machine in question. This was resolved for future issue by adding desktop support as admin.

The first person I had on this issue did not seem to really care about the issue. When I called 
back, I was lucky to get Ms. Payne. Not only did she seem to genuinely care, she also handled 
my lack of patience extremely effectively. Primarily because she seemed to care about the 
problem and showed me the patience I lacked. This woman is amazing! She did not make me go 
back through the checklist and stepped in like she was there from the start. I also think she 
stayed over time a little to finish the step she was working on at the time. I can only pray that I 
get Ms. Payne every time I call with a problem. She deserves a promotion and a raise.

I put a lower score on 'timeliness' since my original request went about a week before it was 
answered. But it was in January before classes started so it is possible staff is scaled back then. 
Also, I am sure they were quite busy with Psychologies move.

Leaving open because of neutral comment. 

The timeliness of the issue is likely due to the fact that on the issue opened email an automatic reply was sent to us which is why a later follow up date was set by a Technician. Thus why she was not contacted back as soon as possible.

Ian was patient and walked me through testing the network connections on the phone, using 
clear instructions. He suggested a temporary solution that I hadn't thought of (using the TTU 
guest network) which enabled our faculty to use the equipment for teaching until the problem 
was fixed.

It seemed to be a challenge to figure out exactly what my Xtender issue was and who could help.  I 
started with CMHC IT, they sent me to HSC IT, and they sent me to Tech IT.   

It was determined that hopefully to resolve my Xtender issue I would require FireFox to be installed.  
I have not had time to allow our IT guys to install as of yet, since I have had time sensitive items that 
had to take priority over my Xtender work load. 

Thank you for your follow up.

The email I received from IT relating to spam was obviously a routine email that is sent to anyone with 
spam email questions.  It had details that didn't specifically relate to my issue such as the email asking for 
my password (which my spam email didn't ask for.)  However, I understand with many spam-type emails, 
IT probably has to streamline.

I called the customer to discuss this issue further, but he did not want to speak with me. 
   
  According to the solution 140828112423919, a Chromecast will not work on the Residence Hall network due to how you must set up the device using another WiFi enabled device. The Google Home uses this same setup method, and I think this is why it will not work. 


   
  I have reached out to RHS/Desktop to confirm that this is what is causing the issue.

Thanks for the help.  I let my password expire and kept hitting "change password" and
it wanted me to login with my password that was expired.??? I didn't know to hit
"forgot password" because I didn't forget it.

The only thing that went slightly awry was the fact that my first email to IT Help Central 
acknowledging the fact that I will no longer have access to my student email's contents may not 
have been received the first time. It was forwarded on the next day, which seems to have been 
sufficient. I am not sure if the original was lost or forgotten, but everything worked out in the 
end. Thank you.

I called the customer at 806-8344976 and left a voicemail apologizing for the time it took us to find a sure answer to their question from ADS. I explained that we didn't have the answer on-hand and had to reach out to other departments to obtain an appropriate and correct response. I will follow up with Randall and Ashley to ensure that this information was documented to prevent this delay from reoccurring if this question is asked again in the future.

I contacted helpdesk as I faced some problems in using BlackBoard on Google Chrome 
recently (one problem was not there before the spring break). I do not know the origin 
of the problem (TTU or BB or Google)! I cannot say that the problem is resolved as I 
am facing the same problem on Google Chrome still and using Firefox as an alternative.

The analyst could have done some basic browser troubleshooting to solve the customer's problem possibly, however her problem was that she could not open attachments and now she can.  If she wanted to use google chrome still she should have insisted on staying on the phone to resolve her chrome issue.

I was calling on behalf of a person who walked into Human Resources and needed help with an 
email account.  She had followed the information given to her by IT Help Central, but couldn't 
understand what options to select to accomplish her needs.  The agent told me to tell her to 
come to your office on 4th Street for further assistance, which I hope will be helpful to her.  I do 
believe she wanted me to do the work for her, but unfortunately I could not break away from my 
job at the reception desk for the time necessary to assist her.

After listening to the phone call, I feel the only reason he gave a neutral rating was because of the hold time. That in itself was only a couple minutes as i'm sure the agent was discussing with people about what possible options the customer had.

IT Help staff have assisted me on 2 issues recently:  Techmail access at home and
Raiderlink access 3/28 at work.  Very good suggestions solved the home email access
issue.  IT was working on the Raiderlink problem.  A staff member even called me to
be sure I was successful in opening Raiderlink.  Recently I had tried to change the
tab/page Raiderlink link opened to the A&F Work Tools.  Fortunately that change
stayed in place also. 
Thank you for your always great service.

Jacob was wonderful! He was diligent, kind, and patient with all of us, including my
computer.  The only suggestion I have is to issue business cards for your employees
as we like to know who's who once they leave the premises.

Also, my printer is no longer hooked up to my computer. I've tried to troubleshoot
it, but I have not been successful.  

Thanks for all you do!

Leaving open due to neutral feedback from customer. 

Setting status to reviewed as the comment isn't necessarily bad because we informed the customer that there is a solution to their issue, but it involves the registry which IT Help Central isn't allowed to tamper with on the customer's computer. We informed the customer of this and continued to follow and after several days the customer responded saying they never updated their computer, but their computer was functioning how it should and told us we could close the issue.

Jacob was so helpful and so efficient. I am so impressed not only by how quickly he was able to set up a 
time to meet me once being assigned to the case, but also how quickly he resolved the issue. Even more 
than that, he helped me even beyond just giving me administrative access, but also by helping me 
download the newest version of SPSS. Thank you, Jacob!!
The one negative piece of feedback I have is that it took a while to actually get a technician to contact me 
about fixing my issue. But once I was contacted, it was resolved the same day!

know that the image could be viewed from his mobile device, as well. I appreciate

Customer is complaining about Timeliness of the service provided. Will received the call on 04/05 @ 8:07 PM and Sara re-assigned the issue to ITHC OSS Psy the same day at 8:14 PM. Based on the issues' notes, OSS Psy resolved the issue 12 days later (04/17). 

I called the customer and left a  voice message apologizing for the delay in response time and lack of  communication. It looks like the issue was assigned to PSY OSS; 12 days  later was the next interaction/notation. Even considering the volume of  work, there should have been some cummunication with the customer.
   
  I  will also be coaching the student that assigned the issue to On-site  support, as we should have informed the customer that their issue was  being re-assigned for assistance.

The respondent is well prepared to use a defined protocol with which to invite customers to 
contact the service desk for assistance. 

As no service was provided, I have no basis on which to respond to the other questions.

From this brief contact, I would guess that the department is trained to be reactive rather than 
proactive.

The young man who first met with me as I entered the office today was very obviously in a 
hurry to end his shift and as a result told me that many of the services that you have 
previously provided to me were not able to be performed at this time.  This caused me undo 
stress and a narrowly avoided trip to Best Buy.  The two young men who came on duty at 
3:30 were delightful and beyond helpful.  I thought that my computer had crashed and the 
young man who was on duty upon my arrival told me it was a lost cause and that he was not 
allowed to even touch what appeared to be a hardware issue.  One of the young men who 
was there asked to see my computer, after sensing my frustration and anxiety, and he 
restarted my computer (which did NOT have a hardware issue), looked at the computer's 
settings, determined the problem and saved me hours, if not days of angst and worry not to 
mention the money that I would have spent on an unnecessary diagnostic procedure!  The 
young man, Kinji, took the time to figure out why my computer was stating that it was 
working at 100% and learned about defragmentation at the same time from the young man 
who was on duty with him.  The other young man, I believe his name is Oliver (?), from 
Houston, took the time to help me install software on my backup computers so that I was 
not stranded during the last three weeks of classwork ( I am working toward my PhD).  Both 
gentlemen were patient and friendly and did not make me feel like I was stupid or that my 
issues were unimportant.  I am very lucky to have such a talented and willing Help Central 
support team as a student here at Tech.  The young man who caused me so much stress 
may need some training in customer service and on how to effectively hand off a concerned 
student to the new staff coming on duty instead of arbitrarily stating that nothing could be 
done.

Caitlynn (sp?), to whom I talked when I called back to try to provide my final solution, was awesome. 
But the original IT person who took my first call (I think her name began with a "V") ... was a 
magnificent representative of Texas Tech!! Please applaud her for her superior Customer Service and 
Technical ability: Kind, sweet, patient, pleasant, professional, astute, knowledgeable. Also, please be 
sure to let her know the solution that resolved my issue.

He was the first person who was able to resolve all the issues I was having in one

others. He was very knowledgeable and I am glad he was available to help me. He 
should be put in charge of training personnel on how to resolve issues for the regional 
sites. This is the first time I have had all my issues resolved without giving up in 
frustration.

Wow!  Both the student technician and student supervisor on duty were incredible. The student  
supervisor was on the phone with me for 2+ HOURS, working hard the entire time to help me solve a 
very complex, obscure, difficult problem regarding HTML files and the mypage external server. I am so 
thankful for his care and support. He deserves a raise! I'm sure he's a great asset to the team. The IT 
support at TTU is incredible. Thanks so much for everything!

We were a bit over zealous in security on this one.  HOWEVER, I would rather be 150%
secure than to accidentally click on a link in what appeared to be a suspicious
email.  It appeared to be an email trying to get me to click on an attachment or a
very long link.  The link and lack of other information in the email, even though
Trintech is a company name we do business with, looked suspicious.  

We also do business with CitiBank but all of campus get those scammer emails
supposedly from Citibank saying "2 suspicious attempts have been made to access your
account" when I don't even have an account with Citibank.  Some TTU employees do use
Citibank.  

Even though the IT Help service ended in my deleting a legitimate email, I would
prefer to err on the side of being secure in the current environment of hackers,
scammers and phishing.  My computer remains virus free, phishing is unsuccessful
thanks to IT Help in 99.9% of the instances.  Trintech happily resent the invoice to
me.  All is well. 

Thank you for your outstanding security service.

Have you considered sending fewer update emails from the helpdesk? I think I see 5 or 6 for 
each url request. It would be nice to see a confirmation for the new ticket, then a confirmation 
the task has been completed. I don't really need to see that it has been escalated or the in-
between communication with TOSM. The transparency is nice, but I would rather not get emails 
as the tasks are handed off from one department to another.

Also -- Why does this feedback from require my full legal name? Can it not display my preferred 
name as with other TTU systems? That name is still tied to my eraider...

Thanks :)

Everyone was extremely courteous and helped the best they could. It did take several months to get this 
resolved.
Original Issue = 580100
Original Project = TTU IT Division
Original Assignees = ITHC GIMs 

Investingating cause of delay 

The issue was linked to the tracking global created for mobile device password/encryption when using TechMail.  It is not clear what resolved the customer's issue by reading the notes, but it appears that Randall assisted the customer and did extensive troubleshooting when the customer visited our walkup support. I'm not sure how we could have improved response time, as I'm not entirely sure what was causing the issue or what resolved it. Maybe Randall can shed some light on the situation? 


   
   



  Randall said:  

   

  "I don't believe that it was actually resolved. From re-reading the issue notes just now and from my fuzzy recollection, I think we just set up Outlook instead of the stock Email app. We told her we would research further, but no one ever did based on what I can tell from the issue. After enough time passed, my guess from knowing her is that she got accustomed to the Outlook app and has forgotten about the Email app."
  However, the customer states in the issue and in the survey that the issue itself was resolved. They didn't answer when I tried calling them, so until they reach back out to me we won't know the answer for sure.

Upon talking to Danny Mar when Dr. Heppert could not work on his Mac, he dropped what he was doing 
and immediately came down to assist.  The issue was caused by our staff when a new rising desk was 
delivered on Friday, May 11 and staff did not check to make sure all cables were connected properly.  
We apologize to Danny for taking up his time.

Thank you for all the work this department handles on a daily basis.

her exclusively work on my issues going forward.  As you can imagine, as an executive assistant 
to a vice president, it is critical that IT issues are resolved thoroughly and efficiently.  Ms. Payne 
is very capable of this and I trust her work following this first working experience.  Thank you!

Whoever helped me was very attentive and patient. He made sure all the proper procedure was 
involved, offered to guide me step by step through the process, and stayed on the phone with 
me to ensure it was resolved in a timely manner. IT or any other help calls tend to be stressful 
and frustrating but this was extremely easy with this help. 10/10 experience.

Blake patiently helped me get my computer back in working order and even went as far as 
helping me to figure out how to get a video from Youtube to upload from my phone.  I had 
been trying to do this for over 4days! He was a life saver! I can not thank you and your 
department enough for your help! This was my last class before I graduate and I cannot 
thank Blake enough for the help! I asked about a survey option because he deserved one! 
Thank you Blake and thank you it department for hiring such a valuable asset. -brady davis

Issue was that when I went to Eraider page and attempted to reset my new password, the page kept 
sending me to ID/username. 
Phone was answered promptly.  Jason was very courteous.  Good instructions.  Because of low phone  
battery on my end, I had to get and write down all instructions, hang up, then proceed on my own.  When 
I went to the "Proxy and Security" setting and scrolled down, the list of choices and boxes was not as I had 
been informed over the phone.  However, I was able to figure out, based on what I was told, how to 
continue on my own  and correct my computer's problem.
And I have successfully reset my password.  Thank you!

The female Supervisor I spoke with regarding my account being locked out was
extremely professional, knowledgeable, and very, very helpful.  Because of her
assistance I was able to log back into my computer and complete work task.  I
apologize, I can't remember her name but I called her at about 4:58 pm on 6/21/2018.

Thank you

The analyst was very helpful, and even though he didn't know how long the IP
addresses were kept, he communicated that, and let me know he'd find out.  He
followed up very quickly with a detailed answer, and instead of just sending an
email, he also called to ensure I understood and could ask questions as well.  Great
customer service! It's really appreciated.

Mr. Evan Akene was awesome! I pulled up thinking he had just received help from It himself. 
He asked if I needed help and said he had just locked the door. I told him no, I would go to 
the library and figure it out myself. He insisted that he would help me. So after multiple 
attempts to refuse, I accepted his offer. He ended having to stay hours to help me off the 
clock. If I was his boss I would give him a raise and a promotion. Forever grateful for the 
help I received.-brady davis

I gather that the analyst might be fairly new as she had to consult with her
supervisor on some of the questions.  However, I appreciated her effort to make sure
she was giving me the correct answers to my questions.  She was very polite.  She was
also very patient with me as I had some trouble navigating the Outlook web site.  
She made sure I understood and did not exhibit any frustration with my slowness.  (At
my age, I don't absorb things as fast as I once did.)

did a good job and I was able to complete the task in a timely manner.  

I appreciate the professional service that was provided.

Flagged all as neutral in that the service was via email only.  The issue was
unresolved, but due to poor design on Microsoft's part.  TTU has no control over the

Had a small problem, but was my fault. I had tried to figure out some steps and had failed

I came in to work this morning and was not able to access Outlook on my computer.  I called IT 
and Zarka answered,  She was very helpful since I'm not a computer genius, she guided me 
through the process and she was very patience since I was a work and got busy.  I admire her 
patience and knowledge.  She was very friendly, and she made me day a lot easier.  If I ever 
have and problems with anything concerning my computer, I hope I will be lucky to get Zarka or 
anyone like her.  Thank you very much Zarka.  I really appreciate you help. Have a fabulous  
day. Juan

Both the person on the phone as well as the analyst who came to the classroom were 
extremely friendly and helpful.  They were able to figure out the issue so that we could 
start our training almost on-time, which I was impressed with for an 8am session.  It 
was nice to be able to call and get a quick response as we have a full day of back to 
back training sessions.

Truly most of these do not apply since the tech helper said they were not to help
with the OLLI issues.
I feel like if they are going to do OLLI registration through this system, they need
to be ready to help.  May a trial run needs to be done before day of opening.  Also,
it should be considered that on OLLI registration there may be a dozen or more
classes requested, not just three or four like most students register for.
I would be glad to help as a trial run participant in the future if needed.
Thank you.

left open because of neutral ratings and mixed comment 

I reviewed the issue and determined that we correctly directed the customer to OLLI for account troubleshooting. The IT division does not manage or assist with account related issues for OLLI, and they have their own support according to solution 180810170347779

Colby was very helpful and didn't give up.

Unfortunately, it LOOKS as though my problem is bigger than I thought. I discovered earlier today 
that I can now go to the Faculty link in Raiderlink, and select a term.

Unfortunately, what I find when I attempt to view my student list is, "You have no assigned sections 
for this term." 

When I look at the Employee Dashboard, the last class listed is Spring 2016 (which is correct), and 
nothing for this semester.  

I'm teaching right now. From my perspective, it seems as though somewhere in this system is a 
gap, a place where some bit of work wasn't done to show that I am hired. Maybe it's something I 
didn't do, but no one seems to be able to tell me what it is. Maybe it's something someone on 
campus didn't do. I doubt if it's a problem with IT, but I've gotten farther communicating with you 
than asking questions elsewhere.  Do you have any idea what I can do next?

After reviewing the call, it seemed that Payal may have been  getting frustrated at the customer's slow computer, and didn't  immediately recognize that they needed to be directed to HSC IT Solutions for  assistance.

Luis's survey tool did not like this survey, so I processed it manually.

  If he was in the list, I figured he would be between Matt Thompson and Matthew Zerrata, but currently he is not.
   
  Setting Issue Agents and Survey Agents to "ITHC CTS Student" for now, and leaving survey open in case it needs to be processed
  differently before being set to reviewed.

I could login but on my iPad when I typed in outlook.com, in the web address it had:
 fs.ttu.edu.  I didn't know what this was and I was afraid someone was faking the
address and trying to steal information.

He tried it on his iPad and got the same thing.  Looks like it is a Apple portal  to
outlook.com.

The most frustrating thing was just dealing with the projector, considering a visiting guest 
speaker via Skype. Service by the analyst was efficient as could be and resolving the issue. I'd 
like to know how to avoid projector failures for future similar scenarios. I plan on Skyping in 
another guest in three weeks.

Ian Hooten is always knowledgeable and helpful.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the 
three day delay after my issue was escalated to staff.  However, Ian did say that I could call staff 
directly if needed for these types of issues in the future.  I am always hesitant to do that.  I have 
worked call centers and I know it is best to follow the normal reporting process as the lead 
technicians are usually covered up by previous tickets.

Hope y'all have a great day!

She was wonderful and did not "pretend to solve my problem" as the previous 
gentleman had done so.  We resolved the problem the first time but then I received a

me..  Thank you again, so much.  Richard B. Cantu

Mixed comments, the ones that seem to be about Payal are positive.
   
  Uncertain what the customer is referring to regarding "she did not "pretend to solve my problem" as the previous gentleman had done so"Linked the IT Division issue to a similar issue from a month ago, may need to listen to those calls to determine what the customer meant by that.

The issue was resolved in a timely fashion. Communication was good. I really appreciate the 
follow-up email since I had missed the initial phone call. I also very much appreciate the detailed 
response provided by the staff. 
So you know, the audio in the telephone message was barely audible. It sounded like the 
microphone was completely saturated.

  (Regarding the voicemail left by Halston, presumably) 

I pulled to call and reviewed the voicemail. The audio quality seemed fine, but i forwarded the recording to halston just in case there is something he can do to improve it.

Please advise on how to prevent this lockout problem. We didn't address this. It 
happens every time I update my password (sometime last week or so). When Wifi network tries to connect to my cell phone or other way around I guess, and fails,,, it continues to try to connect and then I'm locked out of my work pc. I don't want to turn off my mobile network bc I need to be able to stay in contact with my husband as well as get texts.
